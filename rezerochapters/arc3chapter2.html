        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>Upon entering the mansion's lobby, having been seen off by the driver, the two were greeted by,</p>

            <p>"Welcome back, Miss Emilia."</p>

            <p>The words came from Rem, who had erased any emotion from her well-composed face, and removed any warmth from her voice as she bowed. The expression she raised her head with was her typical indifferent one, something he hadn't seen in a while. Inside the mansion lately—especially in front of Subaru—she often wore a smile (a smug one at that). Her attitude hinted at a public façade.</p>

            <p>Overlooking the existence of Subaru, who had returned with her, and only addressing Emilia, further evidenced this.</p>

            <p>"I’m back. Sorry for leaving the mansion unattended... It seems we have a visitor?"</p>

            <p>"A messenger from the capital has arrived. Roswaal is currently attending to them. Would it be alright for you to join them?"</p>

            <p>"Of course. The matter pertains to me, I can't be left out."</p>

            <p>Replying to Rem's query with a nod, Emilia turned towards the staircase leading to the upper floor, then glanced back at a bewildered Subaru.</p>

            <p>"Oh, and what about you, Subaru? Can you find your way back to your room on your own?"</p>

            <p>"Do I look like a child to you? Or maybe I could join…"</p>

            <p>Subaru suggested to the slightly-relaxed Emilia, tilting his head. However, it wasn't Emilia’s perplexed face that interrupted his words but,</p>

            <p>"Ram is already attending them. There is no need for any additional servants. You understand, don't you, Subaru-kun?"</p>

            <p>"Hmm..."</p>

            <p>Taken aback by Rem's final words, Subaru choked on his throat. To Subaru, who couldn’t come up with a rebuttal immediately, Emilia raised one hand slightly and said,</p>

            <p>"In that case, I'm sorry. Rem, please guide me."</p>

            <p>"Sure, Subaru-kun, please return to your room."</p>

            <p>After throwing around apologies, Emilia no longer turned back to look at Subaru. Then, Rem landed the final blow on a lost Subaru, and followed behind Emilia, her silver hair swaying as she disappeared upstairs.</p>

            <p>"Oh, damn it, how irritating."</p>

            <p>When the two were out of sight, foul words, mixed with a sigh, slipped from his mouth. He had been left behind—both physically and mentally.</p>

            <p>"I mean, yeah, with my crappy knowledge about this other world, how much could I help anyway?"</p>

            <p>Two weeks had passed since he first arrived at the estate (equivalent to one and a half months as perceived by him)—and in all that time, the breadth of Subaru's learning had been limited to some basic housework and the art of reading and writing. In essence, his level was akin to that of village children lending a hand at home.</p>

            <p>It was immensely ambitious to involve himself in affairs between nobles—let alone in affairs determining the top of a nation—with such meager skills. He knew his place.</p>

            <p>Therefore, he had accepted being left behind. Not that he was without complaints.</p>

            <p>"Yet, I am not so docile as to return to my room and sleep in indolence."</p>

            <p>If he heeded the opinions of Emilia or Rem, it would be ideal to return to his room and resume his sleep or revise last night's transcription. Alternatively, a valid second-best option would be to vent his frustrations to the indoor girl who had secluded herself somewhere behind the mansion's doors.</p>

            <p>Not a bad idea but surely, he could do more.</p>

            <p>"If that's settled, I should head to the kitchen first."</p>

            <p>His route of action planned, Subaru's feet began to move, a grin of mischievous intent distorting his cheeks. His target: as suggested, the kitchen—to begin brewing a warm cup of tea.</p>

            <p>※※　※　※　※　※　※　※　※　※　※　※　※</p>

            <p>"Won't it be tedious to wait outside the whole time? How about a smoke?"</p>

            <p>The old man who had been sitting on the coachman's seat looked down at Subaru, who had returned with a tray in his hand, and widened his eyes in apparent surprise.</p>

            <p>The location was again outside the mansion, right next to the dragon carriage stationed before the main gate. Despite being subtly intimidated by the hulking figure of the unfamiliar lizard, Subaru, offering tea, gazed up at the astonished elderly gentleman with a half-smile.</p>

            <p>"I apologize for being rude. The surprise made me seem condescending."</p>

            <p>Quickly recovering from the initial shock, the elderly gentleman nimbly hopped down from the coachman's seat onto the ground. Subaru quietly gasped in surprise at the man's grace as his landing barely made a sound.</p>

            <p>The coachman's seat was high enough that it was more apt to describe the man's action as a leap. The seat was slightly higher than Subaru's eye level, and it seemed impossible to get off without preparation for the numbness in one's soles that would follow.</p>

            <p>Yet, contrary to Subaru's conjecture, the old gentleman walked leisurely towards the offered tray, bowed gracefully, and said,</p>

            <p>"I shall gladly accept your offer. Indeed, I was feeling a bit parched."</p>

            <p>"Oh, greetings. I wasn't sure about your preferences, so I ordered the most expensive tea." As he offered the tray, the elderly gentleman carved a gentle smile on his face. As Subaru watches the wrinkles appropriate for the old man's age grace his mouth, he walks closer for a detailed observation.</p>

            <p>The man is slightly taller than Subaru, his hair is fully white and, despite its thinning, it retains an unaffected richness. His clothes seem too formal to be referred to as a coachman's— instead, they are a formal black attire. His back is straight as a pin, and beneath his clothes, his body exhibits a honed agility unsuited to his age.</p>

            <p>In conclusion, he was a person who could make anyone naturally tense with his presence alone.</p>

            <p>"The rank of the older people I know in this other world has been instantly rewritten. Goodbye, old Rom. But honestly, I haven't encountered any scenes where you're active."</p>

            <p>Despite having a deep background as a giant, he left the stage without showcasing his capabilities.</p>

            <p>As for what happened afterwards, Subaru couldn't confirm, but he wondered if things had gotten even more unfortunate for Rom after a severe blow to the head. That was his only slight concern.</p>

            <p>"――I'm simply an old man. There's no need to be on guard."</p>

            <p>As Subaru absentmindedly pondered this, the serene voice of the elderly man interrupted his thoughts. The old man had spoken while taking the cup, and in the interval before he brought it to his lips, he realized he had been under Subaru's rude scrutiny. Smiling at the embarrassed Subaru, he said,</p>

            <p>"It has a good taste. I think you went all out…"</p>

            <p>"It's not even an exaggeration, it really is the most expensive tea. I guess, if the pink-haired maid found out I took it without permission, she'd probably be truly pissed off."</p>

            <p>The seemingly careless, but delicate-tongued Ram had an unexpectedly keen sense concerning tea leaves.</p>

            <p>If she knew that he had used the highly prized tea leaves, marked as "do not take out," she would certainly give him a lecture. However, Subaru proposed,</p>

            <p>"Since I didn't take the tea leaves out of the kitchen and made it inside the kitchen before bringing it out… maybe she could accept this 'Ikkyū-san theory’?"</p>

            <p>"Hmm, you are a tactician."</p>

            <p>"Unfortunately, whether this sophistry will work on the other party is completely up to luck."</p>

            <p>Moreover, it's a gamble that's seventy percent likely to lose. It's absurd to even challenge it.</p>

            <p>Yet, despite the risk, this tea chat had been worth it.</p>

            <p>The old man tilted his cup once more, releasing a deep sigh of appreciation,</p>

            <p>"Well then, what are you hoping to extract using this tea as bait?" The elderly man queries, one eye narrowed as if assessing me.</p>

            <p>Subaru, feeling the bite of his penetrating gaze, sighs, "Hmm. Of the people I've met so far, you’re a tough one to deal with, second only to Roswaal."</p>

            <p>"To be seen in the same light as Margrave Meizeres is an honor."</p>

            <p>"You do realize that essentially equates you to a pervert, right? Though, I prepared myself to get yelled at for that remark just now."</p>

            <p>His expression remains cool, easily brushing aside the comment. Once again, Subaru feels deflated. His carefully honed persona meeting an adversary his inexperienced self is unlikely to beat. He bears no resemblance to the large, bald man from somewhere else.</p>

            <p>Consequently, there is only one thing left for Subaru to do—surrender.</p>

            <p>"I give up. My name is Natsuki Subaru. Currently, I'm serving as an apprentice servant at the Roswaal Manor. At the very least, may I ask for your name?"</p>

            <p>Accepting his junior status and seeking the mercy of his elder is his current modus operandi.</p>

            <p>Before a submissive Subaru, the old gentleman softens his cheeks slightly,</p>

            <p>"Well aren't you courteous. I am Wilhelm. At present, I work for the Crusch's household."</p>

            <p>To Wilhelm, Subaru mulls over the given name on his tongue, "Thank you for sharing your name. Now, could you also share the purpose...or rather, the contents of your visit today?"</p>

            <p>"As far as I think, the messenger is currently discussing that matter inside."</p>

            <p>"I understand, but it seems I've been rather casually marked off from participating in the conversation. It's not very exciting to let the story progress without participating in the event. So, I thought maybe I could approach it in my own way."</p>

            <p>Subaru is well aware that Wilhelm is not one to easily spill details considering their first impressions and prior conversation. However, intruding into the opponent's territory is one of Subaru's specialties; his rich experience of feeling isolated due to his incomprehension of others' feelings is not for naught.</p>

            <p>For a moment, Wilhelm seems at a loss for words at Subaru's persistent demeanor.</p>

            <p>"So, you're not the type to heat up when your speculations are off, but rather you incorporate it into your strategy and move forward. Even when your thoughts are transparent, you don't feel embarrassed, but rather brace yourself. If the opponent were different, this would be a losing disposition that would cause displeasure."</p>

            <p>The words were seemingly harsh at first glance. However, the expression on Wilhelm's face as he spoke them was soft. If the content of his words were true, Subaru's attitude would be undesirable to him, but it seemed that his maturity as an elder had allowed him to take it in stride.</p>

            <p>Subaru lifts his head, "Even just a touch is unacceptable?"</p>

            <p>"I wouldn't be able to say anything rash without knowing your position in the mansion. Please understand."</p>

            <p>Despite Subaru's fairly impolite stance, Wilhelm responded politely, leaving him at a loss. He simply didn't possess the negotiation skills to bend such a rigid person's feelings. At this rate, he was merely fulfilling the conditions to get scolded by Ram by bringing out expensive tea.</p>

            <p>Subaru trailed off, only to be interrupted by, "However, I can infer from earlier that you are close to Miss Emilia, a candidate for the royal election."</p>

            <p>"Oh, oh, oh, you saw that? You saw Emilia-tan and I having a happy, embarrassing blush-inducing conversation?"</p>

            <p>Wilhelm furrowed his brow at Subaru's unfamiliar nickname for Emilia, "Tan...?" Following, he chuckled at Subaru's flippant attitude.</p>

            <p>"You're walking a treacherous path having such relaxed interactions with a woman who might become the next queen of Lugunica."</p>

            <p>"Right now she's just an incredibly cute girl and I'm just a mediocre servant. The future is unlimited, so if we only talk about possibilities, we'll be immobilized, right? Wilhelm-san, when you got married, didn't you think that your wife might be the cutest woman in the world?"</p>

            <p>Wilhelm hesitated momentarily at Subaru's extreme phrasing, "My wife..."</p>

            <p>Quickly refocusing on Subaru, his eyes sparkled with an emotion that could be described as admiration. "I see, you're quite right. I believed my wife was the most beautiful woman in the world too. I felt like everyone was watching her. It's pathetic to worry about being out of her league."</p>

            <p>"Right? Even if I think I'm unworthy, if she's going to belong to someone else, I'd rather make her mine. Somehow, she's within reach, and from here on, I'll work day by day, so I can be worthy of her. That's the ideal."</p>

            <p>This was the train of thought that propelled Subaru's romantic future.</p>

            <p>The fact that he was still unable to convey his sincerity to her was probably because Subaru didn't possess enough substance to reach her. But now, he was thinking, "If that's the case, then I'll try to become more substantial in any way I can."</p>

            <p>"That's why I don't want to remain untouched by Emilia-tan's circumstances. I don't want to lag behind while she's moving ahead. If I let my guard down, I find myself sprinting to catch up. Of course, I would run as fast as I could, but I also want to use shortcuts or whatever I can to keep up."</p>

            <p>"You sure have an interesting way of justifying your actions. It's really intriguing. But if you demand more from me, it would be a bit troublesome."</p>

            <p>He apologetically turned his palm towards him, but Wilhelm shook his head. Maintaining his frank attitude, he tried to calm Subaru down.</p>

            <p>"I am merely a coachman at the end of the day. I don't have a thorough understanding of the situation. I don't think I could be of any help to you."</p>

            <p>"Isn't that a bit hard to believe? You were able to recognize Emilia-tan hiding under a hood. Can you really use the excuse of being 'just a coachman'?"</p>

            <p>".........."</p>

            <p>At Subaru's carefree remarks, Wilhelm's expressionman's fell silent, his expression suddenly vanishing. While watching him out of the corner of his eye, Subaru raised a finger.</p>

            <p>"Well, maybe one could make an educated guess if someone approached the mansion, but that wouldn't equate to certainty, would it? But Wilhelm-san was able to recognize Emilia-tan at first glance."</p>

            <p>"Perhaps I've met Emilia-sama before?"</p>

            <p>"If that's the case, Emilia-tan would have greeted you. It's hard to imagine that Emilia-tan, who loves teaching things, wouldn't introduce an acquaintance to me who was next to her. Besides, the moment yourecognized Emilia-tan under the hood as Emilia-tan, the notion of you being 'just a coachman' seems hard to believe."</p>

            <p>A silent gaze was cast at Subaru for an explanation. Subaru brushed it off with a casual wave of his hand.</p>

            <p>"It seems the robe Emilia-tan was wearing had a complicated magic woven into it. Apparently, it has an effect that obstructs recognition, unless Emilia-tan permits it or the person can bypass that effect. Otherwise, Emilia-tan won't be seen as Emilia-tan."</p>

            <p>That robe was the one she had been wearing when they first met in the capital.</p>

            <p>Subaru, by now, had vaguely understood that her background -- likely due to her being a half-elf -- was obscured to prevent any trouble it might bring. He had just enough insight to understand how heavy a burden the silver-haired half-elf bore living in this world.</p>

            <p>Ignoring Subaru's deep thoughts, Wilhelm seemed resigned, letting out a sigh at the current explanation. Shaking his head weakly in surprise, he said, "To think that you were sizing us up from the outset...you are a sly one."</p>

            <p>"I wouldn't say I'm that clever," Subaru replied. "While brewing tea in the mansion, it just struck me as odd. Pure coincidence, really."</p>

            <p>And yet, being able to seize this opportunity was thanks to Subaru's own determination: to keep Emilia from harm's way. Including the disaster with the magical beasts, Subaru painfully understood how filled with danger this world was. To ensure that these threats were kept at bay from her, he expressed his good intentions through whatever small acts he could perform, exhausting his entire being.</p>

            <p>So he grasped whatever he could grasp and confirmed whatever needed confirming.</p>

            <p>Sporting a light-hearted smile, Subaru had no intention of letting Wilhelm go. From the moment the old gentleman had accepted the initial tea invitation, he'd been trapped in Subaru's world. A world where Subaru conveniently ignored everyone else's circumstances, focusing only on his own.</p>

            <p>"Can 'merely a coachman' be a valid excuse?" he asked. "As you guessed, I am in fact involved in the Royal Selection-- or, should I be more accurate, an associate of an associate."</p>

            <p>"An associate...of an associate..."</p>

            <p>Cornered, Wilhelm took up the role of the defeated. He began to choose his words carefully, speaking slowly. Subaru listened and mulled over the information, breaking down the meaning of his words.</p>

            <p>"So essentially, your position is similar to mine?" Subaru asked.</p>

            <p>"The difference between you and I would be that my reasoning isn't conjecture," Wilhelm responded.</p>

            <p>"Well, if you have the world's most beautiful wife, not even a bit of flirtation would cross your mind, right? I still think Emilia is cuter though."</p>

            <p>"No, I believe my wife is even more adorable," Wilhelm retorted.</p>

            <p>Taken aback by Wilhelm's stubborn rebuttal, even Subaru was caught off-guard.</p>

            <p>Subaru twisted the corners of his mouth into a smirk, shooting a glare at Wilhelm, who had declared his statement clearly.</p>

            <p>"You're surprisingly persistent in weird ways, Wilhelm. A lot more playful than I thought."</p>

            <p>"I would appreciate it if you think of this as the last stand of old bones being cornered by the younger generation."</p>

            <p>Despite the serious tone of his response, Subaru held back his retort, racking his brain to delve deeper into the information.</p>

            <p>If he could find a way to appeal to Wilhelm’s emotions, he might be able to turn the tide—.</p>

            <p>"It seems we've run out of time."</p>

            <p>"Huh?"</p>

            <p>Subaru let out a dumbfounded cry. In response, Wilhelm wordlessly pressed his lips together, gesturing towards the mansion.</p>

            <p>As Subaru followed his signal and turned around, he saw the distant, open doors of the mansion entrance.</p>

            <p>"That's Rem, but who...?"</p>

            <p>The person who had emerged from the mansion with Rem was a blue-haired maid he recognized, along with an unfamiliar person.</p>

            <p>Given the flow of the conversation and Wilhelm's attitude, the stranger was likely the envoy they had been discussing.</p>

            <p>"Why does it have to be so... fantasy-like?"</p>

            <p>Subaru unintentionally let such thoughts slip out of his mouth, perhaps because the stranger’s appearance hardly seemed fitting for an "envoy."</p>

            <p>Noticing Subaru’s staring, the stranger gave a mischievous smile and made her way towards him and the dragon carriage—.</p>

            <p>"Hey, hey. It's rude to stare just because there's a beauty around."</p>

            <p>Upon standing in front of Subaru, she thrust a white finger at him with a winking gesture as she brazenly declared this.</p>

            <p>Presumably, the envoy—a girl with flaxen hair cut bob-style, owned a charming face.</p>

            <p>She was tall for a female, about the same height as Subaru. However, her slim and delicate features starkly contrasted Subaru's sturdier physique. Every one of her movements emanated femininity—in fact, a girlish brilliance.</p>

            <p>She had adorned her flaxen hair with a white ribbon, her large eyes gleamed with curiosity just like a cat, and atop her head, indeed—.</p>

            <p>"We have contact, non-mob cat ears."</p>

            <p>"Nya-Nya?"</p>

            <p>In response to the mutterings, a pair of beast ears––the same color as her hair––asserted their presence atop her head, trembling slightly. In a world where demi-humans were a commonplace sight, Subaru had no interactions aside from the few he had glimpsed in the capital. But now, faced with the real deal, he was awestruck. After all...</p>

            <p>"My soul, as a lover of all things fluffy, cannot resist the existence before me... Damn it, calm down, my right arm...!"</p>

            <p>Enveloped in spectacularly soft fur, the cat ears provoked his imagination, turning her mere presence before Subaru into something dangerously alluring. He rigorously gripped his trembling right arm, managing somehow to keep his distance from her.</p>

            <p>Watching Subaru's strange behavior, she stared at him perplexed.</p>

            <p>"Did I make a bad impression?", she pondered with childlike innocence. "Ferris-chan, I think I messed up."</p>

            <p>She knocked her head with a small fist and stuck her tongue out. This playful gesture sent a shiver down Subaru's spine that was entirely different from before, freezing him with surprise.</p>

            <p>She gave herself a knock on the head and then stuck her tongue out in a cheeky wink!</p>

            <p>Subaru was confronted by an altogether rare sight; an old-fashioned, overused, legendary display of flirtatiousness.  It was so excessively charming that people who act that way would usually annoy him beyond admirableness.</p>

            <p>However, faced with the real deal, the destructiveness was so overwhelming that he was left powerless...</p>

            <p>The crushing charm blunted his resolve to reprove her. The sight was too appealing for him to muster the will to reprimand, as if each element only served to amplify the other. In the end, all Subaru could do was to let it slide.</p>

            <p>While Subaru was left to deal with his complicated feelings for what he'd just witnessed, the girl simply bowed her head without a word. Turning to Wilhelm who came out to greet her, she said:</p>

            <p>"I'm back, Old man Wil. Sorry to have kept you waiting outside. Were you bored?"</p>

            <p>"Not at all. I had the pleasure of enjoying the company of a young lad here. It has been an unexpectedly enjoyable time."</p>

            <p>"Hmm?"</p>

            <p>At Wilhelm's words flirting with their previous interaction, the girl responded sharply, her finger touching her cheek. Pupils of her cat-eyes narrowed, and the corners of her mouth curled into an omega-like expression. Then she relented,
            
            "Ahhhh I see. So you're Emilia's boy, eh? Now it all makes sense."</p>

            <p>The girl scanned Subaru from top to bottom, clapping her hands together as if arriving at a conclusion. Faced with her scrutinizing gaze, Subaru couldn’t resist covering his body with his hands, twisting his frame as an attempt to dodge her lingering stare.</p>

            <p>"Hey, stop it. It's embarrassing being stared at like that just because I'm a guy."</p>

            <p>The girl playfully retorted, "Don't be such a prude, darling. You have a nice figure with hardly any extra fat. It's tantalizing enough that I'd want to taste it if it were not someone else's property."</p>

            <p>The girl's enthusiastic response was to Subaru's jesting, her hands waving in excitement. Normally, Subaru would start getting into the mood with this playful banter with a girl, but-</p>

            <p>"Somehow, I can’t muster the energy. What is this feeling… Physiological?"</p>

            <p>Though it wasn’t exactly disgust, Subaru’s instincts had been vocally protesting since a little earlier. It made it clear that the girl with the mischievous eyes standing in front of him was a clear nemesis to him, Natsuki Subaru.</p>

            <p>A slug to a snake. A toad to a slug. A snake to a toad. In the relationship between Subaru and the girl, Subaru always played the weaker side, and the girl always had the upper hand - his instincts grasped this.</p>

            <p>Therefore, reckless actions, oblivious to the TPO, which were usually expected from Subaru, couldn't be witnessed now. However, the girl, contrarily to the completely off-balanced Subaru, kept her foot on the gas and didn't hold back.</p>

            <p>Specifically, she reached out her hand, gently intertwined her arm around Subaru's neck, and pulled him close.</p>

            <p>"Wha... wha... what!?"</p>

            <p>"Hold still. I'm just checking something."</p>

            <p>Being almost the same height as him, her face was just beside Subaru’s as she embraced him. Her whisper was directly into Subaru's ear, sending a tickling sensation through his body. Subaru's face turned red at the sensation, but as his facial expression cried out for help as it took in the surroundings, he spotted Rem standing near the entrance to the mansion and his face quickly turned pale.</p>

            <p>Even from a distance, he could tell that warmth had further left Rem’s face, which had been expressionless for work. While Subaru was opening and closing his mouth in reaction, Rem mechanically lifted both of her hands and made some sort of gesture.</p>

            <p>Although there was no predetermined code, Subaru was acutely aware of what her expression of intention indicated.</p>

            <p>"I will tell Lady Emilia."</p>

            <p>"Please, no–––!"</p>

            <p>In a quick decision, Subaru managed to pry the girl away who had thrown herself at him. However, he did not do so roughly, but instead simply grabbed her shoulders and held her at a distance. On the contrary, Subaru was the one who ended up collapsing backwards in a daze.</p>

            <p>Unable to process the array of emotions coursing through him in the span of these few seconds, Subaru sat crisply on the ground clutching his arm and,</p>

            <p>"Regardless of my intentions... why does it have to be like this... I have eyes only for Emilia-tan."</p>

            <p>Subaru despaired over the reality of his situation whilst feigning tears. Then, suddenly, a gentle pat came on his shoulder. He lifted his gaze to meet Wilhelm’s, who was extending his hand towards him,</p>

            <p>"I understand," he said softly, a white handkerchief gripped in his hand.</p>

            <p>Subaru gratefully took the offered handkerchief, dabbed his eyes, and rose to his feet, "Thank you."</p>

            <p>He yearned to cling onto the comforting adult figure before him, but then he chastised his own weaknesses and suppressed the urge.</p>

            <p>"But that man has a wife he loves more than anyone... and that's all the emotional tidying up I need to do. So, can I ask about what just happened?"</p>

            <p>Subaru returned the handkerchief, never really having used it, to Wilhelm and asked the girl for an explanation about her earlier behavior.</p>

            <p>At his words, she seemed to ponder while twisting her lips,</p>

            <p>"As heard in the stories, the flow of water inside your body seems to be stagnating. I want to help, but we're short on time so it might be impossible for now."</p>

            <p>Ending on a suggestive note, the girl was content to settle the issue herself.</p>

            <p>Before Subaru could push for further clarity, she stretched out her arms towards the sky and turned around,</p>

            <p>"Let's quickly return to my beloved Crusch-sama, Old Man Wil. If left alone too long, who knows what she could get up to."</p>

            <p>"Indeed, as you say."</p>

            <p>At the girl's firm instructions, Wilhelm complied with few words.</p>

            <p>He made a brief bow to Subaru, placed the empty cup back on the tray that was lying on the ground, said: "Thank you for the meal. Subaru-sama, stay healthy," and swiftly jumped onto the driver's seat of the carriage, readying to take the reins of the lizard.</p>

            <p>As Subaru silently watched, the girl turned to him again, with her hands held together as if for a prayer,</p>

            <p>"Well then, I haven't even introduced myself yet, but I'm in a hurry, so sorry!"</p>

            <p>Leaving a wink in place, the girl turns toward the horse-drawn carriage. Subaru instinctively reaches out for her back, pondering to voice his doubts, but...</p>

            <p>"Wait, I have so many things to ask..."</p>

            <p>"You'll get more out of asking Emilia-sama directly, I think. Well, let's meet again in the Capital city when destiny aligns. Bye!"</p>

            <p>Cutting off his questions abruptly, the girl left a smile behind as she climbed back into the carriage. Understanding that he was completely caught up in her pace, Subaru reluctantly withdrew his hand. Wilhelm softly uttered a 'goodbye' to him, and at the dragon's neigh, the carriage departs.</p>

            <p>The carriage creaks, the wheels begin to turn. The lizard stomped the earth forcefully several times to step forward—with the acceleration swiftly following.</p>

            <p>As the wheels advanced and the carriage started to move, the speed only increased. The carriage swiftly traversed the road while raising clouds of dust, quickly distancing itself.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, all that remained in the location were a crestfallen Subaru, utterly defeated, and the lingering aroma of the luxury tea, almost all consumed.</p>

            <p>※※ ※ ※ ※ ※ ※ ※ ※ ※ ※ ※ ※ ※</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, in the carriage departing from the Roswaal Mansion.</p>

            <p>"Did you fulfill your duties as a messenger?"</p>

            <p>"Of course I did. It's impossible for me to fail something Crusch-sama asked of me. You worry too much, Wilhelm."</p>

            <p>The conversation took place at the coachman's box. Wilhelm was sitting there, effortlessly steering the lizard. Right behind him, a girl with flaxen hair stuck her head out from the window of the private compartment drawn by the lizard.</p>

            <p>Despite the carriage moving at a considerable speed, the Wind Blessing covering it prevented any interference from strong winds, eliminating any concerns about their conversation being disturbed by noise. In some ways, there could've been no better conditions for a private discussion.</p>

            <p>Upon the girl's response, Wilhelm chuckled bitterly and replied, "I worried for nothing, it seems." Then, the girl retorted with a "Well..."</p>

            <p>"I found it surprising that you actually talked to someone while waiting for me, Wilhelm. I mean, you hate talking to others, don't you?"</p>

            <p>"That's a grave misunderstanding, you know."</p>

            <p>At his immediate denial, the girl waved her hands, saying "No, no, that's not it..."</p>

            <p>"Right, my bad, my bad. —I just prefer cutting to talking, that's all."</p>

            <p>"……That's quite a misunderstanding," Wilhelm retorted dryly to the girl's mocking words, choosing not to say any more on the matter.
            
            He reaction to the girl's provocative statement was minimal, causing her to pout in dissatisfaction,</p>

            <p>"How boring. Is your conversation with Felix not as fun as the one you had with that boy earlier? You seemed quite taken with him."</p>

            <p>Her tone was akin to that of a child sulking for lack of attention from their parent. Hoping to elicit a response from the taciturn Wilhelm, the girl leaned even further out of the window and closer to him,
            
            "I didn't feel anything special about him, but did something resonate with you, Grandpa Wilhelm? Like, he’s actually incredibly strong, or you caught a glimpse of his talent?"
            
            "No. My evaluation of him is hardly different. He is a novice – green as green can be. There's nothing particularly remarkable about him. He's likely just another mediocre existence."
            
            "Then why? Traits like that, they’re the ones you hate the most, Grandpa Wilhelm."
            
            The girl seemed intent on painting Wilhelm as some sort of deranged person with every statement. In response to her words, Wilhelm calmly brought his hand to his eye, not even managing a wry smile.
            
            "His eyes."
            
            "—Eyes?"  
            Answering the girl's questioning voice, Wilhelm looked up as if recollecting something,
            
            "That boy's eyes caught my attention. They're the eyes of someone who's repeatedly stepped into the realm of death. There are quite a few who have returned at the last moment from the brink. However…"
            
            Stopping his words there, Wilhelm closed his eyes in thoughtful silence,
            
            "I've never known anyone who has repeatedly danced back from the realm of death. Hence, I suppose he intrigued me."
            
            "Hmm, I don't quite get it."
            
            Unmoved by Wilhelm's wonder-filled words, the young girl bluntly cut him off with her incomprehension. At her response, Wilhelm finally managed a wry smile. The girl continued with a 'but,'
            
            "Regardless of what you said, Grandpa Wilhelm, that boy won't be able to walk an easy path, will he?"
            
            The girl squinted slightly as if recalling something, then stared intently at the large back of the man seated on the coachman's box,
            
            "Being noticed by the 'Sword Demon' Wilhelm van Astrea, it's a misfortune akin to being charmed by a witch."</p>
