        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>Priscilla Barielle does not scorn the "Stargazer".</p>

            <p>The "Stargazer"—seen only in the Vollachian Empire, pitiable beings burdened by a sickness of the mind. Such is the typical perception of them, perpetuated by infrequent encounters with those afflicted, who ostensibly speak with the world itself.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, there are those more likely to entangle with a "Stargazer". Those closely associated with the imperial family. Whether it be the royalty themselves or those attending to their needs—stewards, guards, those placed in such roles might encounter a "Stargazer".</p>

            <p>Because it seems those called "Stargazers" relentlessly seek to interfere with the empire's history. When grand matters worthy of the imperial chronicles arise, they flock to purportedly report them.</p>

            <p>Most importantly, the remarks of these so-called mad "Stargazers" are never taken seriously. Of course, there are those who indulge the words claimed by the "Stargazers", but at least none of the public records state their tattle proved useful. That was the common understanding between the Empire and the "Stargazers", until the current Emperor, Vincent Vollachia, granted Ubilk a title and permission to come and go from the castle.</p>

            <p>As if the "Stargazers" were suitors, ceaselessly burning with unrequited passion for the Empire. Blind devotees who throw everything away for the sake of fulfilling their destiny. Most imperial citizens disdain them, but Priscilla does not scorn or pity them. "Stargazers" are not special enough to be the object of scorn or pity.</p>

            <p>After all, most living beings are slaves to something larger than themselves. Whether it be to a king, family, spouse, love, hatred, or fate; the differences are mere semantics.</p>

            <p>And then ——</p>

            <p>"Even I am not an exception," she murmurs in the shadows, jangling the chains of the shackles forced upon her wrists.</p>

            <p>When choosing words, she seldom cares for the presence of an audience. At the very least, her mutterings are not for soliloquy but meant for another's ears.</p>

            <p>However, it seems the other does not wish for communication, as no response comes.</p>

            <p>Yet, if that being is trying to hide its presence, such meager wishes will not be fulfilled.</p>

            <p>"Hide your breath as you might, an existence such as yours cannot mask its presence. Or is it that you cannot show your face without my gracious approach?"</p>

            <p>"——. With those shackles in place, such actions would be impossible."</p>

            <p>"Of course. Then come closer to me as I will not converse with someone who won't show their face."</p>

            <p>"——"</p>

            <p>There’s a pause, not quite hesitation, but a contemplative silence, followed by footsteps echoing coldly on the hard floor, approaching from the darkness.</p>

            <p>The light in this dungeon is scant, allowing only a faint glimpse of the approaching figure.</p>

            <p>Even accustomed to the darkness, one cannot improve one's night vision unless one purposefully closes their eyes - a foolish act.</p>

            <p>"I do not hide in shadowed darkness without light. When I emerge, it will be boldly, into the light."</p>

            <p>"Such arrogant speech. Very much like you. Caution is advised."</p>

            <p>Following the emotionless voice, a distinct sound of different quality sharply strikes the stone floor. A sharp sound splits the cold air, and a pale blue light rudely dispels the underground gloom.</p>

            <p>"——"</p>

            <p>Instantly revealed in the midst of that light, a visage of alabaster beauty — Priscilla Barielle, her orange hair and crimson eyes like blood, attired grandly in a red dress.</p>

            <p>Shackled in the depths, Priscilla gazes upon the source of the pale blue glow - a young girl with long pink hair and the unmistakable features of a corpse: cracked skin and grotesque eyes.</p>

            <p>If there's a difference between them, it's that this undead child, now seen for the first time by Priscilla, is—</p>

            <p>"—the mastermind behind this 'Great Disaster'?"</p>

            <p>"I will not deny it, but where did you hear such words? You should not have had the chance."</p>

            <p>"The one who brought me my meals was under your command, no? Eager for conversation, are we? Without my asking, he eagerly shared all manners of banal chatter to stave off boredom."</p>

            <p>"A severe warning is in order for General Temeglyph, but—"</p>

            <p>Cutting off her own words, the young undead steps closer to Priscilla.</p>

            <p>Still too far. No matter how artistically long Priscilla's legs may be, even extending her foot wouldn't allow her to straighten her counterpart's bangs.</p>

            <p>"Did you suffer from boredom? ‘Were you able to bear it?’"</p>

            <p>"——"</p>

            <p>Maintaining the distance, the young undead continues her interrupted statement.</p>

            <p>Answering the question, Priscilla's eyes narrow slightly. The tone of the child's query, as if peering into her face, seemed peculiarly intimate — not in a physical sense, but a closeness of minds.</p>

            <p>"It's as if you were familiar with me from before."</p>

            <p>"What do you think? Do you remember me? Is there something that comes to mind?"</p>

            <p>"Unfortunately, I have no penchant for remembering trivialities. You are either someone beneath notice, or this is the first time you have deigned to show me your face."</p>

            <p>"Correct. This is the first time you have seen my face."</p>

            <p>The nodding child’s answer, however, is not the complete resolution to Priscilla's doubt.</p>

            <p>Yet again, her statement leaves a hanging question, making the true purpose clear. — She is testing Priscilla. Observing her like a tethered beast lured by bait.</p>

            <p>Sensing the intent, Priscilla snorts softly.</p>

            <p>"Such irreverence toward me, devoid of fear."</p>

            <p>"It’s true, I do not know fear. It's not just fear I'm unfamiliar with, but as a substitute for my curiosity-driven mother, this is troubling—"</p>

            <p>"Irreverently familiar with me, are we? —The Disaster that befell that village, Kaffleton, was your doing."</p>

            <p>"——. A need for clarification, then."</p>

            <p>The young child catches her breath as Priscilla intercepts the self-narrative to state her suspicions.</p>

            <p>The whispered words behind perpetuate the link between this young undead child and Priscilla's suspicion, but it seems she's at a loss on how Priscilla made the connection.</p>

            <p>"Hmph, isn't it simple enough? Some time ago, in the royal lands now under the Empire... no, throughout the Empire there was a similar disturbance. Such a rare occurrence not once but twice around one's vicinity naturally links them together."</p>

            <p>The incident in question: a Disaster in Barielle territory of the Lugnica Kingdom, centered around the village of Kaffleton, where inhabitants turned into undead.</p>

            <p>Of course, back then, it was not about resurrecting the dead but rather manipulating corpses at will. The queen, identified as the prime cause, was put down, and no further reports of such disturbances surfaced, the event thought resolved.</p>

            <p>"Changing lairs and continuing your 'tests', you seem to have improved somewhat in this macabre puppetry of lacing corpses with worms."</p>

            <p>"Our previous strategy encountered too many obstacles in achieving our goals. It needs improvement," a voice asserted.</p>

            <p>"Will you deny your involvement with Kuffelton?" another questioned.</p>

            <p>"I see no meaning to it. Isn't this a meaningless argument?" The unemotional response of the child betrayed an attitude that loathed inefficiency more than anything else.</p>

            <p>Putting aside the unapologetic tone, the lack of denial was beneficial in obtaining the desired information. However, the dialogue with such a counterpart was—</p>

            <p>"Exceedingly boring, you are," remarked Priscilla.</p>

            <p>"Is that an important matter?" the child replied.</p>

            <p>"If one disregards any beneficial outcome, the only value in conversation I could find might indeed lie there," Priscilla mused.</p>

            <p>"Then, shouldn't you simply not disregard the beneficial outcome?" the child suggested.</p>

            <p>"That is precisely why I find conversing with you so dull. It's like speaking to the dead. At times, even talking to a tombstone feels better as it spares me the annoying responses," Priscilla critiqued.</p>

            <p>The child, with black eyes narrowed, took a step closer, bridging the gap between them. Without a staff in hand, she placed the other on her chest and said, "It's not 'like' talking to the dead, it is precisely a dialogue with the dead. Seeing my figure before you, you surely don't think me among the living."</p>

            <p>"Categorizing something that can barely be considered alive into the realms of life and death is rather tasteless. However, I must admit, your being an undead was somewhat unexpected," Priscilla noted.</p>

            <p>"Why is that?" the child asked.</p>

            <p>"The one orchestrating the ritual turning into the undead is nothing but a careless gamble. Upon death, the spells you've woven may break, possibly nullifying all your plans," Priscilla explained.</p>

            <p>Of course, there was a chance Priscilla was worried over nothing, based on information unknown to her. However, given this child's nature, there was significant room for doubt.</p>

            <p>This girl eschewed inefficiency and wouldn’t reach for something with uncertain proof.</p>

            <p>Yet, she treated her own life as a mere card to induce a "Great Disaster."</p>

            <p>"Faced with an inevitable 'death', you might have reluctantly entrusted your hopes to the afterlife. Or perhaps you were undead even before this Disaster arose. Otherwise—"</p>

            <p>"Otherwise?"</p>

            <p>"If the end of life meant the end of all things, maybe you accepted that as a suitable conclusion."</p>

            <p>Priscilla articulated these three possibilities while gauging the enigmatic intentions of the undead girl, pushing the least likely to the back based on the child's nature thus far analyzed.</p>

            <p>However—</p>

            <p>"Commendable," the child responded to the last of Priscilla's surmises.</p>

            <p>The child—Sphinx—reacted to the possibility Priscilla believed to be least probable. It suggested that the plans Sphinx had formulated around the Kuffelton incident, rotting with her end of life, had been abandoned.</p>

            <p>But for Priscilla, this truth alone was sufficient to furrow her beautiful brows. What increased her concern though, was Sphinx’s reaction upon having her true intentions uncovered—she smiled a smile of satisfaction.</p>

            <p>In the light cast by the staff, Priscilla saw that smile and, furrowing her brows, noted, "Finally, there seems to be some value in speaking to you beyond any benefit."</p>

            <p>"Has something changed?" Sphinx asked.</p>

            <p>"If you can't notice it yourself, I shall graciously inform you. The irony of life sprouting after death is rather too poignant, but—"</p>

            <p>Pausing, Priscilla closed one of her crimson eyes in a moment of quiet, dignified contemplation before reopening it.</p>

            <p>"No, that's not it. You haven't sprouted life after death. You cast aside your own life to reveal it, didn't you?"</p>

            <p>"I did not commit suicide. The opportunity presented itself naturally. So, your speculation of confronting an unavoidable 'death' is not mistaken. It requires correction," Sphinx replied with another smile, mirroring the one before.</p>

            <p>Priscilla, seeing this, clearly sensed the lively rhythm of emotions in Sphinx—the very thing that may have been missing in the child until now.</p>

            <p>Without it, the dead can’t resurrect as undead.</p>

            <p>Therefore, Sphinx proved with her life.</p>

            <p>That she had every right to become an undead, to reincorporate the soul into a clay vessel, to cling to this life for a reason.</p>

            <p>It was a choice far from efficient, hardly an effective strategy.</p>

            <p>"But isn't that what emotions drive us to?" Sphinx pondered.</p>

            <p>"Indeed, they do," Priscilla agreed, still with her hand on her chest, a hint of daring in her stance.</p>

            <p>The void of interacting with a lifeless puppet was gone, replaced with the tension of facing an entirely different, inorganic yet decisively unique being.</p>

            <p>"Previously, I underestimated the significance of this, and my plans in the kingdom suffered for it. While I failed to become the kingdom's 'witch', it seems I have been chosen to become the empire's 'Great Disaster'," Sphinx declared.</p>

            <p>"Chosen, you say? Is that the reason you bring Disaster?" Priscilla inquired.</p>

            <p>"Correction. It's not a motive; it's my foundation," Sphinx clarified.</p>

            <p>Listening to Sphinx, Priscilla began to mold her vague suspicions into shape.</p>

            <p>Those doubts, darker than the gloom of the dungeons, began to take clearer form as Sphinx brought light with her words and expressions.</p>

            <p>"My name is Sphinx. In the Lugunica Kingdom, they also called me 'the witch'," Sphinx announced, looking straight at Priscilla.</p>

            <p>So it was, Priscilla finally grasped the full implications of the child's—Sphinx's— words and demeanor.</p>

            <p>Mentioning Lugunica Kingdom and 'the witch' was likely to differentiate herself from other individuals known as 'witches' elsewhere.</p>

            <p>While the six 'witches' besides the 'Witch of Envy' had all but vanished from history, they were still universally recognized as 'witches'.</p>

            <p>But if she specified being the 'witch' of Lugunica Kingdom, there was only one who fit the bill, a figure complicit in the "Demi-Human War." Easy to discern from history.</p>

            <p>However, the 'witch', self-proclaimed as Sphinx, didn't mean to reveal such trivial information to Priscilla. What 'the witch' really intended to convey was—</p>

            <p>"That you, surpassing a life of no consequence and becoming an undead, this life sprouting after death, is due to me."</p>

            <p>It was a declaration of war from Sphinx to Priscilla, suggesting that the reason behind becoming the 'Great Disaster' lay with Priscilla herself.</p>

            <p>The situation was obvious from the start—too transparent to even ponder.</p>

            <p>In the imperial capital's conclusive battle between the empire’s army and the rebels, Sphinx, leading her undead, intervened as the 'Great Disaster', blurring the outcome of the civil strife.</p>

            <p>Amidst the battle, Priscilla and Yoruna, who were focused on clashing with Arakiya, lagged in grasping the developments on other battlefronts and, consequently, found themselves a step behind in the undead's machinations.</p>

            <p>Now, Priscilla was chained in the dungeon, unaware of the statuses of both Arakiya and Yoruna.</p>

            <p>Because Yoruna had cast the "Soul Marriage Technique" on Priscilla during their fight with Arakiya, it was almost certain that Yoruna was alive. Even without this technique, Priscilla had resigned herself to captivity in exchange for the unconscious Arakiya's safety and for the visibly shaken Yoruna's well-being.</p>

            <p>This arrangement only held if the enemy indeed intended to capture Priscilla.</p>

            <p>In essence, Priscilla's continuing survival while tethered here undeniably indicated that the opponents had use for her.</p>

            <p>"I had thought it was Lamia who so fervently valued my life."</p>

            <p>"Princess Lamia Godwin was, in fact, in favor of sparing you. She had a strong attachment to you. Her last moments—"</p>

            <p>"—I have no intention of sharing the time between Lamia and me with anyone else."</p>

            <p>Priscilla sharply dismissed that as vulgar curiosity.</p>

            <p>To Priscilla's emphatic statement, Sphinx simply responded, "Is that so?" and withdrew from the conversation effortlessly. Though she had broached the topic, it seemingly held no interest for her.</p>

            <p>This was also evident in the fact that Priscilla continued to live even after Lamia's second death.</p>

            <p>"Attachment is such a curious thing. It's too often influenced by elements antithetical to rationality. Yet sometimes, the irrational yields results that surpass rationale, which I found hard to comprehend."</p>

            <p>"And is it rationality or irrationality that you prioritize in speaking with me?"</p>

            <p>"Which could it be, I wonder? It's fresh... needing to ponder such things."</p>

            <p>Did Sphinx realize, as she answered so, the rapid humanity infusing each of her words while she conversed with Priscilla?</p>

            <p>Regardless of being conscious or unconscious of it, Sphinx, watered by dialogue with Priscilla, was demonstrating significant growth in her emerging humanity.</p>

            <p>"——"</p>

            <p>Priscilla's realization of Sphinx's true motives, left unspoken, had not been denied.</p>

            <p>Sphinx's nonchalant attitude towards digging deeper into the matter all but confirmed its central place in her motivations. The one thing that vexed Priscilla, where she admittedly was outdone by Sphinx, was that Priscilla had no clue about the source of Sphinx's intense fixation.</p>

            <p>Of course, being of Priscilla's status, it wasn't uncommon to be the subject of one-sided attachment by those she did not know or merely knew her name. But Sphinx's obsession clearly surpassed any self-indulgent degree.</p>

            <p>There was a reason. A reason that dated back to the beginning of "The Great Disaster."</p>

            <p>"You mentioned something intriguing earlier."</p>

            <p>"——"</p>

            <p>"All living beings are slaves to some greater entity. I didn't understand that before, but now it seems I'm beginning to grasp it."</p>

            <p>Sphinx started the interesting conversation, and Priscilla silently responded.</p>

            <p>Not out of disregard or scorn, but as if driven by a perilous curiosity, Priscilla found Sphinx's initiation intriguing.</p>

            <p>This "witch," who had never understood and now showed agreement with Priscilla's words, was about to begin what kind of tale?</p>

            <p>Indeed, urged on by Priscilla's silence, Sphinx continued.</p>

            <p>"Therefore, within irrationality, one can find a new form of rationality. It's something that deserves attention."</p>

            <p>With those words, Sphinx struck the floor forcefully again with the glowing staff. The blink from the jewel-encrusted staff briefly intensified, and suddenly, the jewel's surface changed.</p>

            <p>—The once faintly transparent crystal now reflected a scene from the imperial capital beyond the dungeon walls.</p>

            <p>Like the principle of a conversation mirror capturing the other side, Priscilla narrowed her eyes at the light, sensing an elaborate spell beyond mere remote viewing.</p>

            <p>"You’ve mentioned we should pay attention," Priscilla asserted.</p>

            <p>"What do you intend to show me?"</p>

            <p>"The correctness of your words and the outcome of my new equation."</p>

            <p>Sphinx's statement, linked to something she had said before, made Priscilla contemplate what could be showing on the crystal. And as Priscilla realized, the image in the jewel became clear.</p>

            <p>What unfolded before Priscilla was—</p>

            <p>"Understanding emotion and fixation, I now know how to utilize them. She's quite diligent, isn't she? For your sake, she spares no expense of herself. —Quite the need to ponder."</p>

            <p>△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>—Meanwhile, at the real scene depicted in the orb, at the same moment:</p>

            <p>"Good grief, seems I did Groovy a disservice. I always believed my intuition never failed me at crucial moments—yet I was completely mistaken."</p>

            <p>With a light-hearted tone, the voice acknowledged its own misstep, quite contrary to its confident air.</p>

            <p>Yet, in neither the timbre nor expression was there any hint of hesitation—it was because the speaker did not seem to give a second thought about their own blunder, nor was the apology particularly serious; rather, the speaker had concluded that his intuition was half right and half wrong.</p>

            <p>Having left the ostentatious distractions to his allies, he sprinted through the undead-ridden imperial capital, heading for the pinnacle of the castle walls, to a location known as point five, which should have held his target.</p>

            <p>Of course, his gut feeling was just that, and calling it conviction would undoubtedly lead to reproach by many.</p>

            <p>But at least he, himself, was confident that this was the moment to shine.</p>

            <p>By coming here, the world's star actor, Cecilus Segmund, would be able to showcase his brilliant performance for the loud and attentive audience.</p>

            <p>That was when—</p>

            <p>"—So, do you have any excuses?"</p>

            <p>"How about this for a response? My intuition wasn’t wrong. Because here lies what I truly desire indeed!"</p>

            <p>Beside him, Al, holding the charred remains of what once was a camouflage cloak and expressing resentment, received Cecilus’s buoyant reply.</p>

            <p>Actually, whether that was true or not was beyond Cecilus's knowledge, but he preferred to trust himself rather than doubt, which was far more positive.</p>

            <p>"Don't you think so too, scantily-clad lady? A gloomy face attracts a gloomy outcome. Hence, the face a star actor bathed in light should wear goes without saying."</p>

            <p>"——"</p>

            <p>Above them, aimed at a figure hovering in the air above the castle walls, Cecilus called out loudly, but no reply came from the individual.</p>

            <p>However, the first "greeting" from the individual had been received—it set the surrounding area ablaze, attempting to incinerate Cecilus and Al, who were hidden beneath the leather cloak.</p>

            <p>And yet, despite having done all that, there was not a hint of hostility or intent to kill from the individual towards Cecilus or Al.</p>

            <p>The only thing present was the plea of a girl with her brown skin mostly exposed, her slender body seemingly on the verge of bursting from containing something so immense within her, crying as if in lamentation. The circumstances under which this entity entered her were unknown, but—</p>

            <p>"By any chance, have you consumed something harmful? —Truly, you're such a handful."</p>

            <p>"—..."</p>

            <p>"What's this? That strange sensation just now..."</p>

            <p>Before he could grasp what it was, there was movement overhead.</p>

            <p>The light blinked, and a tremendous force threatened to annihilate Cecil and Al from above. In the face of it, Cecil licked his lips, while Al threw aside his leather coat exclaiming,
            "Damn it! —Territory Redeployment!!"</p>

            <p>The desperate scream was devoured by the shockwave, and the most intense clash in the City of the Dead commenced.</p>
