        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>The imperial city of Lupgana had been occupied by the undead. Now, it was more appropriate to call it a "Corpse City" rather than an imperial city. In Lupgana, Al was still tirelessly searching for Priscilla, whose whereabouts was unknown.</p>

            <p>However, it was difficult to say that his search for his master was going smoothly. After all, the basic approach to finding a person is questioning eyewitnesses, but here, there was no one to even tell baseless rumors, let alone decisive testimonies.</p>

            <p>All that could be found were the undead, who approached with dangerous intent as soon as they saw a living being, or survivors who kept their heads low and stayed silent, prolonging their lives by taking no action at all.</p>

            <p>Either type of person was of no help to Al. Yet...</p>

            <p>"Even if you meet a living person, that doesn't necessarily mean your goal would be achieved, isn't that the irrationality of the world, Al-san?"</p>

            <p>Such was the frivolous remark of the very embodiment of irrationality, Cecilus. While he completely agreed with that statement, Al didn't have the luxury to debate it with him at the moment. After all, Al was hanging from the edge of the rooftop of a five-story building.</p>

            <p>"Damn it!"</p>

            <p>Inside his iron helmet, Al let out a curse and looked away from Cecilus's smug face. It was pointless to say anything to Cecilus in this situation. After all, the reason he was hanging like this was because Cecilus had kicked him off the rooftop. He'd purposely called him to the edge of the roof and, making him think there was something in the distance, kicked him from behind.</p>

            <p>What else would you call that if not malicious intent?</p>

            <p>"Whether it's a test or check, the goal is to assess. The fact that you didn't fall headfirst shows that your reflexes are better than the Boss's," Cecilus chirped.</p>

            <p>"Is that so? I don't understand what you mean."</p>

            <p>"It doesn't matter if you don't understand! I am the one who grasps my thoughts and wishes. And let me tell you, I won't assist you in pulling yourself up, Al-san."</p>

            <p>With that, Cecilus clapped his hands, answering Al's questions in an unwanted and cheery manner. The reason for his outrageous behavior hadn't been clear until he had explained it; not that his explanation helped. Even if we were having this conversation around ill-intentions or a murderous intent, Al was not one to chat long with Cecilus.</p>

            <p>Having been saved from the formidable undead creature, light introductions were exchanged, and Al shared his progress up to this point and his future goals—he was then promptly kicked off the rooftop.</p>
            
            <p>It was indeed a stroke of extraordinary misfortune to encounter such a being, yet, Al was not particularly disheartened by his response.</p>
            
            <p>After all—</p>

            <p>"—I didn't have high hopes since I've been asked so many times,"</p>

            <p>With this retort, Al released his grip on the ledge of his own accord and surrendered himself to freefall.</p>

            <p>"Oh?"</p>

            <p>Cecilus' surprised voice grew distant as Al's thoughts raced within the fleeting sensation of zero gravity. </p>
            
            <p>There was about fifteen meters between himself and the ground, a distance those with superhuman abilities could easily land from, but since Al was no more than an average human, he would surely die a grisly death, like a squashed tomato.</p>
            
            <p>The approaching ground was sodden cobblestones, certainly not enough water to soften the impact of the fall or muddy soil to cushion the fall either. The conditions were exceptionally harsh.</p>
            
            <p>Hence, a different action was crucial here to ensure his survival.</p>

            <p>"Aaaahhh!"</p>

            <p>With a yell originating from the depths of his throat, Al straightened his bent knees and kicked hard against the wall.</p>

            <p>Al, who was expected to fall straight down, instead gained diagonal momentum, dramatically reducing the distance between himself and the building of the same height opposite to where he clung earlier. The timing of the kick had to be just between one and two seconds after the start of the fall; if too early or too late, he would crash into the wall, severely injuring his head and meet the aforesaid squashed tomato's fate.</p>
            
            <p>Yet, with this precise timing— in an instant, Al smashed through a window on the building.</p>

            <p>"Guaaah!"</p>

            <p>The broken window glass went flying with him as he tumbled roughly into the room, back-first. His back and shoulders were cut by the glass, and the hard floor inflicted substantial damage.</p>

            <p>"But, I survived…"</p>

            <p>With a rolling somersault in the slid room, Al bounced up and verified his survival. He then checked for any fatal wounds or broken bones in his limbs. Only after clearing those checks could he affirm his survival.</p>
            
            <p>If he had any irreversible injuries at this point, he'd have to reverse them.</p>

            <p>"Whoa, where's my left hand!? Oh, right, I haven't had that for almost twenty years now…"</p>

            <p>After a moment's pause and the insertion of his usual small joke, Al immediately hid beside the door that led into the corridor, swiftly drawing the Azure Dragon Sword from behind his waist.</p>

            <p>He avoided falling to his death. But in doing so, he made a loud noise as he crashed into the building.</p>

            <p>Naturally, that noise would draw the attention of others nearby—</p>

            <p>"Here!"</p>

            <p>"Yes!!"</p>

            <p>With a frantic dash, an undead bashed open the door and stormed into the room. With a roar full of vigour, the gaunt white face of the undead swept past. As it passed, Al swung his Green Dragon Crescent Blade, decapitating the creature effortlessly.</p>
            
            <p>He quickly confirmed the imminent threats using the body of the beheaded undead as a shield. Beyond the broken door were two more, and the echo of footsteps climbing the stairs suggested another: total of three. Over the corpse of the first, the second undead recovered from shock quickly, thrusting its short spear.</p>

            <p>What a fast recovery. Disturbing.</p>
            
            <p>As that thought crossed his mind, he used the headless corpse to intercept the spear’s path—</p>
            
            <p>“Made a blunder.”</p>
                
            <p>The body of the undead, once receiving a fatal blow, shattered like dispirited pottery. And only after tasting the enemy’s short spear sink fatally into his chest did Al remember that this familiar strategy would not work on those vanquished zombies.</p>
            
            <p>×　×　×</p>
                
            <p>"Is this the place?!"</p>
            
            <p>"Yes!"</p>

            <p>With another frantic dash, Al cleaved off the head of a zombie that had just strode into the room, having mangled another door in its way. He kicked the annoying headless body aside and leapt deeper into the room. That didn’t deter a second undead, who chased him brandishing its short spear.</p>

            <p>“Doona!”</p>

            <p>The shift spear got ensnared by an earthen wall that suddenly emerged from the floor, forcibly keeping it captive. Catching the enemy distracted, with his foot upon the earthen wall, Al called out,</p>

            <p>"Doona! Doona! Doona!”</p>

            <p>Where Al's foot touched, earthen columns sprang sideways from the wall, taking the zombie on the other side head on and blowing it back. The earthen column pushed back the second undead and another that had been trying to follow from behind together. Columns sprouted one after another, and with a force likened to a multi-stage rocket, the earthen columns knocked out and crushed the two zombies against the passage wall.</p>

            <p>"Just one left...!"</p>

            <p>From between the columns and the walls, there was the sound of large pottery breaking. Al, with his foot still against the wall, remained wary of the enemy's movements, having taken out the first three in one go. The vanguard was surprised, the wingman and the middleman were defeated with his tactics. All that was left was either the lieutenant or general, and if they gave up due to their deteriorating situation, Al would be safe—</p>
                
            <p>"Well, that won't go so smoothly!!"</p>

            <p>The earthen columns that blocked the entrance were obliterated as the last zombie forced its way into the room with a show of primal brutality.</p>

            <p>It was a cyclops from the undead tribe, wielding a giant battle-axe and featuring a golden colossal eye in the center of its face. At first glance, Al knew that this creature was far stronger than the previous three they had faced. Panic surged through him, and he made a desperate dash towards the room's window—,</p>

            <p>"Will I make it?!"</p>

            <p>Even as his scream cut through the air, the destructive force of the horizontally swung battle-axe hit him square in the back. Al was sent flying, his internal organs grossly decorating the building's interior as he met his gruesome end.</p>

            <p>× × ×</p>

            <p>"Here?!"</p>

            <p>"Yes!!"</p>

            <p>Rushing in with frantic strides, a decapitated undead creature that had broken through the door was at the forefront. Next was a pair in the passage, and he was aware of the worst enemy coming up the stairs. With this in mind, Al took a big leap backwards—,</p>

            <p>"Dona!"</p>

            <p>Faced with the second and third front line, Al had no choice but to open a bloody path to deal with the final monster.</p>

            <p>△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>"Wow, that's amazing! Despite how formidable that cyclops who jumped in at the very end appeared, you really held your own against it."</p>

            <p>"Damn bastard..."</p>

            <p>"Oh dear, it might not be pleasant to badmouth an opponent who gave you such a challenging fight. Of course, foul language and verbal abuse can be impactful, but I don't like the idea that infamy is better than anonymity!"</p>

            <p>"I'm not saying this to you…"</p>

            <p>Wounded all over his body and panting heavily, Al exited the building and was met by Cecilus. Leaning heavily on the wall for support, Al slumped down. At the same time, Cecilus, who had confronted Al, was left wide-eyed.</p>

            <p>"I genuinely don't get how you can look so surprised after being told off like that. On countless occasions, you've nearly killed me. Even psychopaths should remember the times they've incited hatred in others…"</p>

            <p>"Hmm, since I haven't been able to learn all of the boss's words in such a short period of time, there are definitely some I don't know. For instance, what does 'psychopath' mean?"</p>

            <p>"It's pretty much the same as 'freak.' Someone who can attempt to kill others without so much as batting an eye."</p>

            <p>"Huh. But, in that case, I don't think I'd qualify as a psychopath. After all, for some reason, you don't die, do you?"</p>

            <p>Cecilus responded with a flippant laugh and a twisted sense of self-defense. Al, who was still crouched on the spot, focused on regulating his breathing in response to Cecilus's answer. While Al remained silent, Cecilus raised a finger and continued.</p>

            <p>"The single-eyed tribe member earlier showed quite the skill. Regrettably, he falls far short of me, but if it were you, Al, you would lose one hundred times in one hundred attempts. This is a truth I have witnessed!"</p>

            <p>"…But I'm still alive, right? Or are you saying I'm dead?"</p>

            <p>"No, no, you are indeed alive. I had a suspicion that perhaps you were a kind of undead pretending to be alive, but that doesn't seem to be the case. This leads me to one possible conclusion. —Al, you won on your hundred-and-first attempt."</p>

            <p>Cecilus made this statement, showing two raised fingers—one from the hand he had just hold up, the other from his opposite hand. Even if you added those fingers together, it only made two, or at most eleven in a more generous reading, yet it was not the non-reflective gesture but his words that left Al breathless.</p>

            <p>"I wouldn't stick to the number of a hundred and one. It could be a hundred and two, a hundred and three, even two hundred, it's fine! Al, you would lose to that one-eyed tribesman one hundred times out of a hundred attempts. But what if you tried it a thousand times, ten thousand times, a hundred thousand times? You could create a literal “one in ten thousand” situation. You drew it first. Am I wrong?"</p>

            <p>"—"</p>

            <p>Pretending to focus on settling his breath in silence was hitting its limit. Within his helm, unseen by the other, Al contorted his expression, feeling a deep-rooted fear for Cecilus from the bottom of his heart. His compelling gaze and words were utterly incomprehensible, even to Al.</p>

            <p>The current way Cecilus spoke almost directly alluded to Al's abilities. The young man who proclaimed himself as Cecilus Segmunt—an oddity in this world—possessed not just the Vollachia Empire's strongest title of the “Blue Lightning”, but had also intuitively guessed Al's ability, without any form of logic.</p>

            <p>"Your height, it might be for the same reasons as me and my siblings…"</p>

            <p>Just as Al and Subaru had been reduced to children by Olbart, it was entirely plausible that Cecilus had been shrunk by Olbart as well. While the individual did not identify himself as the "first" among the "Nine Divine Generals", there was a sensation of one's consciousness being drawn into their appearance when the “infantilization” became severe. It is highly likely that Cecilus was under the same circumstances.</p>

            <p>In Al's case, his mind was forcibly optimized, but that rough treatment could only be done by Al and Subaru. Hence, it made sense to believe that, without any other ways left, Cecilus' mind had been diminished.</p>

            <p>If Olbart's recklessness was what transformed Cecilus into a young monster, the implications were grave indeed.</p>

            <p>"Is it because you can't answer, or because you don't want to answer... which is it?"</p>

            <p>In response to Cecilus's quietly asked question, Al raised himself from the wall he had been leaning against. The uneasy tinge in Cecilus's silence was a testament to the pendulum swinging wildly back and forth within him. A pendulum determining whether he would stand as Al's foe or ally, a fixation on trivial matters irrelevant to the historical disaster they were faced with, even in this corpse-ridden city.</p>

            <p>"I got to thinking. If perchance, Al-san, you were to draw the one in a million straight from the start... would I be able to draw the same against you?"</p>

            <p>In that scenario, it wasn't just one in a million but a possibility of one in a billion or one in a trillion was entirely plausible. However, if it wasn't zero...</p>

            <p>"Let me make this clear... I suggest you stop digging into my charm. If you don't, you'll end up regretting after being glowered at by someone unnecessary."</p>

            <p>"What a way to talk to me! I don't hate it, rather, I quite like it."</p>

            <p>Al sighed at Cecilus's response, which seemed more amused than anything else. He would have liked to find words to dampen Cecilus's enthusiasm, but from the looks of things, they were out of time. They had barely survived the onslaught of corpses from the fatal fall. The strain was considerable, but they needed to push forward.</p>

            <p>"――Domain Cancellation, then re-deployment, thought experiment reactivation―"</p>

            <p>Before Cecilus could make any unwarranted moves, Al redefined the matrix he had initially set up. The backlash was immense due to the frequency and scale, but Al decided to ignore the considerations until he could leave the Vollachian Empire.  ――Getting Priscila back was his top priority.</p>

            <p>"The cause is worth it, so I'll do it――Guaa!?"</p>

            <p>It was just as he was about to utter his resolve. Quicker than he could say it, Cecilus's form in front of him became blurred, and immediately after, he was flipped sideways by a kick to his ribs from the sole of Cecilus's boots. Al screamed as he slid across the ground.</p>

            <p>"This, this isn't right! After going on about how things would look on stage, you're attacking me in the middle of a conversation!?"</p>

            <p>"No, no, no, that's not it! I'd never do something so crude! That would be a serious breach of decorum, almost enough to commit seppuku! But look, see here―"</p>

            <p>"What the hell is...?" As Al picked himself up from his slide, Cecilus, making an excuse, pointed at the wall. There, right where Al had been standing just moments ago, was a fist-sized hole, right at chest height.</p>

            <p>It hadn't been there before. Suddenly, the wall was perforated.</p>

            <p>Which means...</p>

            <p>"Snipe... Gah!"</p>

            <p>"Excuse me!"</p>

            <p>In the split second Al widened his eyes, Cecilus blurred again and without a moment's delay, Al experienced G-forces racing through his body, propelling him backwards with undeniable force.</p>

            <p>Cecilus ran fiercely, his hand gripping Al's waist as they dashed away together. As if they had become the wind, hot on their heels...</p>

            <p>"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, what's going on!?"</p>

            <p>Within the disorienting sensation of being flung backwards, Al's view was filled with city streets and building walls being pierced. Something terrifying was pursuing them, swirling and dancing through the air.</p>

            <p>If his first impression was correct, that was sniper fire. The sniper fire was chasing Al and Cecilus.</p>

            <p>"If it's a sniper, they shouldn't be able to move! That's the basic rule!"</p>

            <p>The standard sniper tactic is to lie in wait, patiently line up the shot, and then deliver a fatal blow with a single bullet.</p>

            <p>That's the fundamental principle of sniping. Yet this sniper was deliberately pursuing Al and Cecilus as they fled, even preemptively aiming at them as they sought cover behind obstacles.</p>

            <p>It was as if they were surrounded by a hundred snipers, or that one sniper was capable of moving about freely with an unhindered range.</p>

            <p>"Whoa! Careful! Steady!"</p>

            <p>"Bloody hell! Ow! I bit my tongue!"</p>

            <p>While being targeted by such precise and flexible sniper fire, Cecilus continued to evade the barrage as he carried Al along with him, moving left, right, up, down.</p>

            <p>But, he never once looked around. Al noticed. --- It was all instinct. Cecilus was dodging the superb sniper fire purely on gut instinct.</p>

            <p>"No way I can manage all that. Don't you feel on edge when your opponent makes their move? That's what's happening."</p>

            <p>"Forget my doubts! Just focus!"</p>

            <p>"That's fine. But this opponent is extremely skilled. --- I've crossed paths with him several times, but he's never given me a clean shot."</p>

            <p>The ground thundered with a sound not unlike a sandal being kicked, propelling Cecilus forward as he accelerated. With the invisible gunman and his sniper fire nipping at their heels, Al felt a double shock at Cecilus' revelation.</p>

            <p>There were two truths. One, that Cecilus had already encountered this enemy several times, and continued to survive. The other, that this enemy was an incredibly challenging adversary, one that even Cecilus hadn’t managed to defeat.</p>

            <p>"I believe it flies in the sky, but I can't see it for reasons other than speed," Cecilus stated.</p>

            <p>"An invisible... enemy..." Al mumbled, picking up on the keyword in Cecilus’s casual remark.</p>

            <p>Uncovering the mechanism behind its invisibility or, at least, coming up with some sort of contingency...</p>

            <p>"Oh! What's this?"</p>

            <p>Cecilus's voice, once again lacking urgency, rang out, harmonizing with a colossal crashing sound emanating from behind Al—specifically, from their direction of progress—causing him to whip his head around.</p>

            <p>In Al's field of vision, three buildings toppled onto their path. Pressing in from the front and both sides of the street, these structures all seemed to have their foundations, the very parts that supported the buildings, targeted and gouged out, causing them to lean and collapse diagonally.</p>

            <p>Being crushed would undoubtedly result in death. The moment he realized this, Al gritted his teeth,</p>

            <p>"Redefining boundary—"</p>

            <p>"I'll push us through the front!"</p>

            <p>Immediately after resetting the boundary, Cecilus, who had scooped up Al, broke through the windows of the collapsing building in front of them, rushing inside. As the building angled, windows cracked in response to the distorted walls. Amid the chiming cascade, Cecilus kicked off the next falling floor, shattering the ceiling and crudely creating a fast-pass route from the lower floors to the upper.</p>

            <p>"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"</p>

            <p>Since the building was falling, the devastating touch with the street was certainly beginning from the lower floors. However, to escape such a crushing demise through such a wild scheme was beyond any sphere of sanity. It was unthinkable. Unspeakable.</p>

            <p>But through this outrageous decision, both Al and Cecilus managed to escape by breaking through the ceiling of the top floor, even before the building fully collapsed—</p>

            <p>"—No, this isn't good," Al breathed out.</p>

            <p>Breaking through the ceiling, Al and Cecilus leaped out into the sky. Below them, the three falling buildings collided with each other; their enormous mass creating an earth-shaking rumble as they crumbled. One of the buildings must have been storing flammable alcohol or magical gems, as a fiery explosion spread across the streets.</p>

            <p>However—</p>

            <p>"This is indeed a tough enemy!" Cecilus remarked with a nonchalant tone that didn't suit the looming danger.</p>

            <p>The joyful cry of Cecilus and the trembling of Al's body from the impact happened simultaneously. However, the recipient of that shock was not Al. It was Cecilus who had leaped into the sky with Al - he had been targeted, and the shock was from his leg being blown off.</p>

            <p>A small left leg was blown off below the knee, and the boy clenched his back teeth while spraying blood into the air. Al knew it from experience. The pain comes quickly, and one's throat screams out---,</p>

            <p>"---Over there!"</p>

            <p>Instead of screaming, Cecilus yelled, spotting the enemy in the distance. Maintaining his grip on Al, he deployed his remaining leg against Al's body, using him as a foothold to propel towards whatever he'd spotted.</p>

            <p>Propelled by a single leg, his momentum was furious. Even in this state, without a leg, he would likely catch up with the enemy.</p>

            <p>"---That won't do."</p>

            <p>Even with a leg missing, Cecilus was probably a hundred times stronger than Al. But it wouldn't work. He needed him in perfect condition. Therefore, Al drew his Blue Dragon Blade, holding it to his own throat. And, with no hesitation, he brutally swung the blade---</p>

            <p>×　×　×</p>

            <p>"Right in front---"</p>

            <p>"No, it's the building on the right!!"</p>

            <p>Just as Cecilus was about to charge directly into the building falling from all three directions, Al shouted over the noise of the collapsing structure, causing him to change course. The moment Cecilus heard Al's plea, he laughed and licked his lips.</p>

            <p>For an instant, Cecilus forcibly changed his direction, still holding Al, and rushed into the right building that was falling. Hearing the chain sound of shattering window glass, Al pointed towards the back of the room they'd jumped into,</p>

            <p>"That room! Secure the box inside!"</p>

            <p>"Aye aye sir!"</p>

            <p>Without questioning Al's assertive instructions, Cecilus smashed violently through the wall to the next room. Inside, there was a metal box - a part of the wealth that this building's owner had stored, intending to take out in case of emergencies.</p>

            <p>Regrettably, it seemed that the owner couldn't manage to take out the box despite the preparations, but, thanks to that, Al and Cecilus were able to secure it.</p>

            <p>"Up!"</p>

            <p>Just after securing the box, they decided to escape from the tilted building, using Cecilus' off-the-beaten-track leg strength and thinking.</p>

            <p>Cradling Al, who was carrying the box, Cecilus' sprint pierces the ceiling of the lower level, through the floor of the upper level, repeating this again and again, dashing up to the top floor in one breath.</p>

            <p>Then, the moment they kicked through the ceiling of the top floor and leaped outside, Al drops the box in his hand in front of a scene he had seen so many times that he had lost count.</p>

            <p>Just as it was, a sniper's bullet from far away was about to blow off one of Cecilus' limbs -</p>

            <p>"――Dona"</p>

            <p>In the dropped box, Al’s crude spell ignited a pure magic stone, once the property of someone in the Empire. The ensuing explosion of flames swelled up, engulfing both men from beneath.</p>

            <p>"――――"</p>

            <p>As they experienced the sensation of their skins being roasted in the inferno, the curtain of flames served to shield Al and Cecilus from their surroundings. However, even if the flames hid the two of them for this moment, the sniper would still aim for them — no, still pinpoint Cecilus and shoot.</p>  
            
            <p>Therefore, the aim was not to distract the sniper's eye.</p>

            <p>"—There"</p>

            <p>Cecilus, having muttered that, grins, baring his teeth.</p>

            <p>He spews blood from his cheek, hit by the sniper, his bound long blue hair bursting open. And yet, all of Cecilus' limbs remained intact.</p>

            <p>The curtain of flame was not to hide Cecilus from his enemies, but to make the approaching bullet visible to him before it reached.</p>

            <p>Before it reached Cecilus, the bullet would break through the curtain of flame.</p>

            <p>It was an absurd idea, but it was a bet that he believed, Cecilus would not miss the change in the flames the instant the bullet reached him. The bet won.</p>

            <p>— For that reason, through the curtain of fire, the gaze of Cecilus and the sniper crossed.</p>

            <p>"――――"</p>

            <p>In an instant, the pupils of Cecilus' eyes narrow, and the sole of Zori is applied to Al's waist.</p>

            <p>Just like before, Cecilus intends to fly down to the shooter whose location he has determined. The difference from before is that all of Cecilus' limbs are attached to his small torso.</p>

            <p>From here, the rest is —</p>

            <p>"—I won't let my guard down."</p>

            <p>With that, Al firms up his preparation for reploying to the next region.</p>

            <p>Each time, his head experienced a sense of loss as if something was being torn apart, but as Cecilus said, you never know. A one-in-a-million chance only comes once in a million times.</p>

            <p>If it's going to be desired twice, it cannot be due to compromise.</p>

            <p>Therefore, Al sets up the next matrix again —</p>

            <p>"—Cloud Breaker"</p>

            <p>Just before that, Al's view was marred by a peculiar shift. It originated beyond the curtain of flames, in the direction where Cecilus had surmised the sniper was, in the sky where no enemy could be seen, there was a disturbance in his view.</p>

            <p>To put it bluntly, the clouds were slashed apart. Suddenly, the thick black cloud that covered the sky of the Necropolis Lupgana was ripped apart. Not one slash, but two or three in succession.</p>

            <p>As if they were chasing an invisible enemy in the sky -- no, it wasn't just that. The slashes were pursuing the enemy, and their aftereffects were tearing the black clouds apart.</p>

            <p>"Argh! I'm gonna get him! He's escaping!"</p>

            <p>The scream-like voice belonged to Cecilus, who kept his feet on Al's back. The reason behind his wide-eyed shriek was the fleeing sniper, who was escaping from the slashes ripping through the clouds—it was a reaction to the fact that the sniper was abandoning the fight and retreating.</p>

            <p>To Al, it was a fortunate turn of events, but not for Cecilus. His eyes filled with frustration as he glared at the scene below.</p>

            <p>And there --</p>

            <p>"Hahaha! Run, run! Be afraid of my sword skills!"</p>

            <p>Far from the three collapsing buildings that Al and Cecilus had leapt out from, the figure of a man standing on the rooftop of a building could be seen. He held a sword in his hand, waving it cheerfully as he watched the enemy retreat on the skyline, the sword that had sliced through the clouds pointed to the sky as he laughed.</p>

            <p>Seeing the unfamiliar face, Al frowned. As he did, Cecilus, who noticed the abrupt intruder, pointed out,</p>

            <p>"You seem to have aged a bit while we haven't seen you, Dad."</p>

            <p>"Dad?"</p>

            <p>At Cecilus's nonchalant remark, Al was left speechless. The man at a far distance, whom Cecilus had called his father and would supposedly join them -- the real concern was:</p>

            <p>"... Surely, we won't die after this, right?"</p>

            <p>Looking down at the continuous intense collapse of the three buildings, and still enjoying the sensation of floating, Al mumbled those words, leaving their fate up to Cecilus.</p>
