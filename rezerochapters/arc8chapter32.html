        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>――The extermination of the Vollachian Empire by "The Great Disaster", and the operation to prevent it. The continuous resurrection of the undead army, and knowing that facing it head-on would only hasten annihilation, what is needed is a swift resolution. Since we cannot indulge in a grand showdown between the living and the dead, it was a natural outcome to initiate a mission of infiltrating the enemy lines with a small but elite force. The problem at hand was――,</p>

            <p>"Who will storm into the enemy's stronghold?"</p>

            <p>Crossing his arms, Subaru, who was sitting in the middle of the room, looked around. In a large room of the fortress city of Garkla, a fitting place for a large gathering, all the allies of Subaru, excluding the empire officials, were assembled. There, the members who did not participate in the recent meeting due to the treatment of the wounded――Ram, Garfiel, Petra, Frederica, and Rem were all present. Of course, Anastasia and Julius were there too, being non-empire personnel――,</p>

            <p>"I'm also glad that Halibel-san returned safely."</p>

            <p>"Oh, how kind of you to be concerned. I honestly appreciate your concern since Ana-chan is harsh on me."</p>

            <p>Leaning against the wall with a tobacco pipe in his mouth, Halibel answered Subaru's words with a smile.  The strongest wolf man in this city-state, who had stopped the Dragon Zombie, which appeared before the attack of the undead in the battle of the linked dragon carriage, was a contributor to their victory. All thanks to him for not allowing the Dragon Zombie to come near the carriage, the damage was kept to a minimum. Let alone, he managed to slay a dragon on his own, he's quite an extraordinary shinobi.</p>

            <p>However, regarding Halibel's statement, Anastasia looked displeased as if she had been mocked.</p>

            <p>"What is it? When you speak like that, I sound like an employer who has neither blood nor tears. I always say that I will pay for what one has worked for."</p>

            <p>"Oh, this is just like you. Even though you try to settle everything with money, you seem to be losing your charm... Is it not because Ricardo is an anarchist that you've become stubborn?"</p>

            <p>"Ha..l..i..bel..."</p>

            <p>"Alright alright, I admit defeat."</p>

            <p>The exchange of Kararagi dialect between the two was settled by Anastasia's lukewarm call.</p>

            <p>Even though they're old acquaintances, their casual banter reminded Subaru of a familiar uncle and his young niece. Anastasia, short in stature and with a cherubic face, was usually far from being childlike due to her mature personality. This impression of her was rare for Subaru.</p>

            <p>Paying no mind to Subaru's impression, Halibel, who had been outsmarted by Anastasia, didn't allow the conversation to end with just a "yeah, that's right," and continued speaking.</p>

            <p>"From our fight, it seems like the zombies from Vollachia and Kararagi have slightly different behaviors. I don't think I'll get along well with them."</p>

            <p>"Different zombies in Vollachia and Kararagi? What do you mean by that? You're not saying that some other cause is triggering a zombie panic at the moment, right?"</p>

            <p>"I definitely don't think that’s the case. From my perspective... the Imperial zombies seem tougher. The kid who set it up did something nasty to the Great Spirit of the Empire, so it might have something to do with distance."</p>

            <p>"Distance…"</p>

            <p>While moving his pipe up and down with his teeth, Halibel expressed his thoughts.</p>

            <p>Subaru, who didn't know about the undead of Kararagi, didn't understand the subtle nuances in the differences. However, there must be some difference if a warrior as strong as Halibel had noticed it.</p>

            <p>He didn't want to believe that zombies were being used for different reasons at the same time.</p>

            <p>"It seems more like a matter of the degree of completion rather than distance."</p>

            <p>"What do you mean by that, Julius?"</p>

            <p>"If Halibel thinks the Imperial zombies are stronger, then it's a fact that they are more capable. However, the zombies from the city-state appeared earlier chronologically. So what we can infer from this is…"</p>

            <p>"The zombies in Kararagi were used as test subjects, and the zombies in Vollachia are for the real deal. Knight Julius, is that what you mean?"</p>

            <p>Asked by Anastasia, Julius, touching the scar under his left eye, expanded on his conjecture. Upon hearing Ram's words, he responded with "Exactly," and continued,</p>

            <p>"If my current theory is correct, it would explain Halibel's impression. So Halibel, may I ask why you think the Imperial zombies and you would not get along?"</p>

            <p>"I haven't seen it directly, but the number of zombies coming out of the dragon carriage seemed to be increasing, right? Something similar happened with that black dragon too. As you know, my attacks are known for their cursed death, if their effect strikes true, it would mean the end. But if the opponent doesn't die, it would be a terrible match for me."</p>

            <p>"-------"</p>

            <p>"Huh? What's with this silence?"</p>

            <p>"Well, I just got surprised cause Halibel casually mentioned his specialty being "cursed killing".</p>

            <p>Subaru wasn’t exactly sure how to react to Halibel so casually revealing his hand, but Halibel merely nodded at Subaru's comment as if he understood, stating,</p>

            <p>"I mean, knowing doesn’t really change anything. Even if you’re aware, there aren’t many people who could avoid even a single blow from me, right?"</p>

            <p>"Hmm, humble yet not humble. Reinhard and Cecilus are the same... all of them strongest of their respective countries share this trait, it seems..." 
            
            Subaru was deeply impressed at Halibel's unabashed strongman speech. Cecilus, a condensed desire for approval, was one thing, but even the humble and sincere Reinhard, had absolute confidence in his own ability. 
            
            In reality, there's no persuasive strength when someone as defiant as him says “I'm like that”. Nevertheless, he preferred the straightforwardness.</p>

            <p>In any case,</p>

            <p>"Understood that Halibel is struggling to fight the "zombies"... but what do we do then? Who should we send to the Imperial Capital?"</p>

            <p>"Well, don't expect much from Kararagi's strongest, but even then, I vouch for Halibel’s skills. I truly believe that he should be part of the infiltration team," Anastasia, indifferent to Halibel's protests, differed.
            
            "Well, I wouldn't cry and throw a fit saying 'I don't like it,'" Halibel gave a forced smile.</p>

            <p>Indeed, even though “zombie” kills might not be effective, there was no doubt that Halibel could fight a black dragon alone. While considering him a confirmed member of the infiltration team, Subaru raised his hand to draw the attention back to the main topic, "Can I say something?"</p>

            <p>And then,</p>

            <p>"Let's get this clear, I’ll be participating in the infiltration team."</p>

            <p>That’s right, faster than anyone else could volunteer, Subaru had declared his intentions.</p>

            <p>"------"</p>

            <p>His candidacy drew everyone’s gazes, creating a brief moment of silent suspense.</p>

            <p>Seizing this opportunity, Subaru got the opportunity to explain why he should be the one to infiltrate.
            
            "First of all, everybody knows Spica’s power against 'zombies' - her power to nullify resurrection. Right now, to use it, the guardian, me, is needed as an escort. If even Halibel finds the enemy’s revival troublesome, then Spica is definitely needed for the capture."</p>

            <p>Spica contributed to the defeat of the formidable foe that attacked the dragon carriage chain, Lamia Godwin, dubbed the "Poison Princess".  If she can master "Gluttony", she can sever the "death escape" of the endlessly reviving undead. For the defeat of the Sphinx, no plan would be more valuable than Spica.</p>

            <p>"Both Spica and I have irreplaceable roles. ...So, necessarily, Beatrice will have to come with me to the Imperial Capital."</p>

            <p>"Betty is willing to. I've had enough of being separated from Subaru."</p>

            <p>"Sorry, I appreciate it."</p>

            <p>Beside Subaru, who raised his hand, little Beatrice, who was sitting, grasped the hand Subaru had raised tightly, agreeing to accompany the assault party as well. As she affirmed, Subaru, bolstered by his partner's response, looked at Spica - crucial to their plans - and Rem, whom Spica held.</p>

            <p>Spica, wrapping her arms around her waist and hugging her, and Rem, lending her shoulder for support, met Subaru's gaze,</p>

            <p>"...Why are you looking at me with such jittery eyes?"</p>

            <p>"Well, it's because I'll be taking Spica to a dangerous place again, and if Rem starts to dislike me for it, my heart will shatter..."</p>

            <p>"--- Well, Emilia could console you, couldn't she?"</p>

            <p>"Huh?"</p>

            <p>To the unnecessarily defensive Subaru, Rem averted her eyes, her voice tinted with dissatisfaction. As Subaru struggled to comprehend the meaning of her words, beside him, Rem's sister, Ram, stood with narrowed, faintly reddish eyes,</p>

            <p>"Do you want to tear him to pieces?"</p>

            <p>"Don't suddenly say such alarming things, Sister!"</p>

            <p>"Just kidding. He'd just revive if we tore him to pieces now, wouldn't he? A multiplying corpse... a nightmare. Horrifying."</p>

            <p>"Don't freely kill him and then call it horrifying!"</p>

            <p>At Ram's all too Ram-like declaration, Rem gave a bitter smile, shaking her head lightly before saying a word of gratitude to her sister.</p>

            <p>"I appreciate your concern, Sister. But as you said, he will just revive no matter what we do, so let's put it off for now. Rather..."</p>

            <p>"Hmm?"</p>

            <p>"Spica, do you think you can do your best with him?"</p>

            <p>Wiping off the bitter smile from her face, Rem looked down at Spica, who was clinging to her, and asked. At the question, Spica widened her blue eyes before promptly setting her face into a determined expression.</p>

            <p>Questioned about her role and what she should do, the young girl nodded vigorously several times,</p>

            <p>"Ahh-uhhh!"</p>

            <p>She affirmed with a voice that was barely audible. Rem's expression was a mixture of loneliness and regret as she accepted this. As if to express her feelings more palpably, her voice trembled when she continued.</p>

            <p>"I'd like to go with you, if it were possible... but I know that if I were to go now, I'd just be a burden... However..."</p>

            <p>"---You don't need to worry about that, Rem,"</p>

            <p>Rem's heartfelt plea was cut off by a reassuring voice.</p>

            <p>Startled, Rem opened her ultramarine eyes wide, the voice had come from Emilia, who was thumping her own chest.</p>

            <p>Emilia's beautiful purple eyes filled with determination as she nodded at Rem.</p>

            <p>"I understand your worries—about the child and Subaru and the others who are going with us. That's why I'll protect everyone, no matter what happens!"</p>

            <p>"Emilia... san..."</p>

            <p>"Leave it to me. I'm stronger than I look,"</p>

            <p>Emilia flexed her muscles and smiled at Rem.</p>

            <p>At Emilia's incredibly reassuring words, Rem didn't know what to say, her eyes flitting about.</p>

            <p>However...</p>

            <p>"No, no, no! What are you talking about, Lady Emilia? There's no way we can let you go!"</p>

            <p>"What? Why not?"</p>

            <p>"Don't you understand why not if I don't tell you!?"</p>

            <p>Otto was even more stunned than Emilia, who was looking at him with wide eyes.</p>

            <p>Ever since they met up in the Empire, he had seemed almost perpetually grumpy, but now, for the first time, they could see his usually flustered face—it was hardly a laughing matter.</p>

            <p>In reality, Otto's argument was more reasonable than Emilia’s.</p>

            <p>"How can we send Lady Emilia into the most dangerous place in the Empire because of this operation?"</p>

            <p>"But Otto, bro. If we're talking about dangerous places, isn't it already too late since we're in Vollachia?"</p>

            <p>"It's hard to deny, but there are various risks to consider. As Natsuki-san says, the Imperial Capital is the enemy's stronghold... The defense of a strategically worthless village can't possibly be the same as that of the capital. Without a doubt, the Imperial Capital is the most dangerous place," Otto admits, eyes flicking between Subaru and Beatrice.</p>

            <p>"Well, makes sense," submits Garfiel, withdrawing his opinion as he's confronted with undeniable logic.</p>

            <p>Driven by his discussion with Garfiel, Otto keeps his gaze on Subaru and Beatrice, and continues, "Honestly, I'm against your going as well, Natsuki-san. After all, this is a problem of the Empire, and it's absurd to risk your life for another country."</p>

            <p>"Honest as always. But like we've said many times..."</p>

            <p>"I know," Otto interrupts. "It doesn't matter where it happened, whether in the Kingdom or in the Empire. If there's a chance that the 'Witch' is targeting Lugunica, I agree with you. I'd rather see the Empire become a wasteland than my home."</p>

            <p>"You're not hiding your strong sense of loyalty anymore, are you?" Subaru replies.</p>

            <p>The usually serious Otto seems to be struggling with the merits and demerits of getting involved in the problems of the Vollachian Empire. Even so, Otto understands. For Subaru, it's not about territories, it's about the people whom Subaru has come to care for in a country he dislikes. Subaru would want to do everything he could for those people.</p>

            <p>That's why...</p>

            <p>"It's not just about Spica — I need to be in the Imperial Capital," Subaru declares.</p>

            <p>The reason Subaru volunteered to be part of the infiltration team was, of course, because he has decided to accompany and protect Spica, who is capable of wielding great power. However, his primary goal is to change destiny in the Imperial Capital — the likely site of the fiercest battles — and to prevent an unavoidable "death" that awaits there.</p>

            <p>To win over all the sword slaves on the "Gladiator Island," Subaru took a considerable risk. But it was worth it. As long as there's a reward, Subaru won't hesitate.</p>

            <p>"Betty doesn't want Subaru to do anything dangerous either," says Beatrice, asserting her own thoughts on the situation to Otto, who keeps his gaze on her and Subaru.</p>

            <p>Beatrice, her blue eyes marked with a distinctive pattern, locked gazes with Otto as she explained.</p>

            <p>"But, using that girl's powers to dismantle the 'Sacrement of the Immortal King' could be beneficial. Furthermore, if by any chance, we need to seal Sphinx, we should be able to with Betty’s power."</p>

            <p>"You mean, to seal her?"</p>

            <p>"If Spica's authority proves ineffective, the only way to stop Sphinx's wanton actions would be to seal her. If she manages to escape by committing suicide, it would mark the beginning of a never-ending chase. To prevent that, I guess it's time for Betty's magic."</p>

            <p>The figure that came to Subaru's mind as he saw Beatrice extending her characteristically roundish, young girl's hand, was a scene reminiscent of the expression "sealing" that Beatrice mentioned. The outcome of "Gluttony", Sin Archbishop, Roy Alphard, who was successfully apprehended at the Pleiades Watchtower. Roy, his whole body solidified like wax with shadow magic, was restrained, unable to move or even think.</p>

            <p>"Indeed, I believe the 'Witch of Envy' was caught in the same kind of seal…"</p>

            <p>"That's the case. It's a 'witch-sealing', with proven trust and track record. If the situation requires us to seal Sphinx, I hate to impose on you and Petra, but we can't do without Betty and Subaru."</p>

            <p>Having received backing from Beatrice from a magical perspective, Subaru glanced over at Otto, and further on at Frederica and Petra standing in tandem. The increasingly reliable and promising Petra, whom he hadn't seen in a while, was understandably not thrilled with Subaru's idea of infiltrating the Imperial Capital dressed like her miniature self.</p>

            <p>However, the cunning girl understood the validity of Beatrice's argument. If the undead army couldn't be stopped here, the damage would increase exponentially. Therefore, with a very reluctant sigh, she admitted,</p>

            <p>"So, it has come to this after all."</p>

            <p>"Petra…"</p>

            <p>"It's the same as Rem-san. I don't have a choice but to follow. But it’s at least a relief that Beatrice-chan will be acting as the overseer and coming along with..."</p>

            <p>With a sharp understanding, Petra expressed her concerns about Subaru whom she feared might endanger himself again. This left him with a pang of guilt, and as Petra placed her trust in her, Beatrice nodded in affirmation.</p>

            <p>"I understand what Petra is feeling. As long as Betty is here, Subaru won’t face any danger."</p>

            <p>"Yes, thank you, Beatrice-chan."</p>

            <p>"Right. I feel reassured when Beatrice is with Subaru, and it makes me happy. But if I could be with both of them..."</p>

            <p>"Lady Emilia..."</p>

            <p>"Ugh..."</p>

            <p>Following on from Beatrice and Petra's beautiful friendship, Emilia tried to persist in a not-so-subtle manner, only to be shot down by Otto's stern gaze. However, as mentioned earlier, Subaru agreed with Otto's opinion on this matter. While Subaru would love to fulfill anything that Emilia wishes for, granting this specific wish would involve taking her straight into the most dangerous place in the Empire.</p>

            <p>But on the other hand, Garfiel's argument did carry some merit. The fact that they were in the Empire already ensured danger, it wasn't guaranteed that staying in Garkla would keep them safe. In that sense, it would be ideal to have everyone Subaru knew by his side...</p>

            <p>"---I, for one, am in favor of having Lady Emilia joining the team that enters the Imperial capital."</p>

            <p>"My lord!?"</p>

            <p>But then, quite unexpectedly, a radically different opinion emerged. Frederica voiced her surprise, with an expression that doubted her own ears. However, it was not just Frederica who reacted; almost everyone present was unable to conceal their surprise at this proposition - a remark from Roswaal.</p>

            <p>Amidst this prevailing shock, Anastasia recovered quickly. While adjusting her fox fur collar, she frowned and said, "Well, that's a surprising opinion. I thought for sure that everyone would be opposed to Emilia-san's suggestion, except Emilia-san herself."</p>

            <p>"The fact that Lady Emilia, the representative of our faction, can not have her opinion accepted is most unfortunate... But that is a jest. I did not take an opposite stance out of malicious mockery."</p>

            <p>"....Let's hear it."</p>

            <p>Roswaal shrugged his shoulders at Otto's prompting, his voice and expression holding back emotion. Subaru, Emilia - as the one being supported in this scenario, and those around, all held their breath in anticipation of Roswaal's thoughts. Amidst all eyes set on him, Roswaal closed his eyes, leaving only his yellow one open...</p>

            <p>"It's not a complicated discussion. In the context of our alliance with the Empire, Emilia-sama's abilities are a substantial factor that we can propose to our counterparts. If Anastasia-sama had suggested going there, everyone should have stopped her, but it's not like that with Emilia-sama. That was acknowledged by everyone when Emilia-sama participated in the war before zombies appeared."</p>

            <p>"Yes, that's right! You see, even at that time, she collided with Madelyn and Mezoreia, but she managed to come back safe and sound."</p>

            <p>"The situation is different. What's needed is a surprise attack by a small elite force, and Emilia-sama's bold... audacious battle style is hardly suitable..."</p>

            <p>"It's within the scope of compensation. Besides, if Emilia-sama is there, even if the operation fails, we can accommodate the recovery in the operation. She could freeze about half of the Imperial Capital, couldn't she?"</p>

            <p>Roswaal raised a finger, making such an outrageous statement, but it wasn't as reckless as it sounded. Emilia had the unique unit performance that couldn't be replaced, the incredible amount of mana she could supply by herself, and the skill of a super ranged attack that made full use of it.</p>

            <p>In short, Emilia could transform the battlefield into a winter scene all by herself and cheerfully dash around in the extreme cold. Subaru came up with the "Ice Brand Arts" to take full advantage of her overwhelming extensive combat capabilities, and Roswaal even evaluated it highly.</p>

            <p>In reality, there was no doubt that Emilia was one of the top combatants in the camp. After making her participate in the Pleiades Watchtower and the battle of the Imperial Capital, saying that Emilia couldn't be dispatched because she was in danger was not a convincing argument.</p>

            <p>In addition to that, Roswaal had his unique conviction.</p>

            <p>He concluded -</p>

            <p>"Subaru-kun also... You'd be more motivated if Emilia-sama was there, wouldn't you?"</p>

            <p>"You..."</p>

            <p>Facing Roswaal's malicious grin, Subaru unintentionally bit his lip.</p>

            <p>His narrow remark was clearly mocking Subaru's ability, which only Roswaal knew about - "Return by Death".</p>

            <p>Roswaal didn't know that the trigger for Subaru's time reversal was "death", but he did know that Subaru had such a trump card. He was also convinced that Subaru would not hesitate to use this trump card for Emilia's sake.</p>

            <p>Roswaal's calculation was correct.</p>

            <p>No matter what happens to anyone else, Subaru's desperation when Emilia is involved would likely go beyond what Roswaal is seeking. However, only Roswaal would potentially be convinced by such circumstances.
            
            "Sir, I am also against Emilia's departure, just like Otto."</p>

            <p>In fact, even after listening to Roswaal's opinion, the opposition could not be shaken. Even Frederica, who typically sides with Roswaal within the faction, prioritized the precariousness of the situation and opposed Emilia joining the infiltration team.</p>

            <p>"Of course, I understand that Emilia is stronger than me or Otto, but still, I can't disregard her safety..."</p>

            <p>"---I will accompany her. Does that surprise you?"</p>

            <p>"Eh?"</p>

            <p>Unable to agree, Frederica who was protesting, widened her eyes.</p>

            <p>Short, but unmistakable, that was Roswaal's claim. Waving his raised hands for everyone to see, he said,</p>

            <p>"I will accompany Emilia and the others for the infiltration of the Imperial Capital. Fortunately, now that there's no need to hide our true identities, I should flaunt all my skills, big and small."</p>

            <p>"Eh, Roswaal, you're coming with us? No, you'll accompany us?"</p>

            <p>"Are you surprised?"</p>

            <p>"It's because you always seem to be taking it easy at the mansion."</p>

            <p>At Emilia's honestly surprised reaction, Roswaal gave a wry smile.
            
            While 'taking it easy' is a very Emilia-like expression, the fact that Roswaal is often not present at the scene of problem-solving comes down to two major reasons. The problems are usually caused by Roswaal himself, and he is not a reliable ally.
            
            Yet, Roswaal has no reason to betray their trust in this situation.</p>

            <p>Considering the unlikelihood of Roswaal scheming anything in the Empire, it could be said that he is in a more trustworthy position now than he was in the kingdom.</p>

            <p>"I question the reliability of allies who can be trusted more in foreign lands..."</p>

            <p>Upon hearing of Roswaal's accompaniment, aside from Beatrice who made a sour face, Subaru thought that the proposal was nothing but beneficial.</p>

            <p>If one discusses the highest combat power of the faction, without a doubt, Roswaal is one of them.</p>

            <p>"I too---"</p>

            <p>For a moment, Otto seemed to say something. However, his half-formed words were interrupted by a gritting of teeth. Drawing a deep breath, he exhaled and said,</p>

            <p>"Garfiel! Please accompany Natsuki-san and the others."</p>

            <p>"―Huh, y'okay with that? If all the strong ones are dispatched, it'll be just like the 'Three Knights' mission."</p>

            <p>"At this point, a half-hearted commitment would be unwise. Including this, I don't like being in the palm of the Frontier Count."</p>

            <p>"Otto-kun, you often stand up for me."</p>

            <p>Roswaal said with a relaxed smile as Otto put a hand to his forehead. Seeing his older companion's distress, Garfiel gnashed his teeth and pounded his chest with a fist.</p>

            <p>He made a dry sound, forcefully stepping on the floor.</p>

            <p>"Alright. I'll take on Otto-nii's worries, Petra's worries, and even my sis's concerns."</p>

            <p>"Garf, you’re forgetting about Ram's worries."</p>

            <p>"I ain’t interested in carrying your worries about Roswaal!"</p>

            <p>"Idiot, there's no need to worry about Roswaal-sama. Worry about yourself, Garf."</p>

            <p>Garfiel, who had decisively made up his mind, was struck by Ram’s blow and his momentum was dampened to a "gao".</p>

            <p>After showing off her sinful womanliness, Ram looked at Roswaal, who had volunteered to join the assault party, and said,</p>

            <p>"By all means, please show the Empire the extent of Roswaal-sama's power."</p>

            <p>"Indeed. The Empire has been somewhat underestimating magic."</p>

            <p>At Roswaal's smile, Ram picked up her traveling skirt and curtsied.</p>

            <p>Observing the exchange of neither excessive nor insufficient trust, Emilia, who had been left behind in the conversation, blinked her eyes.</p>

            <p>"So, in the end, Roswaal and Garfiel are coming too, and I'm going with Subaru and the others to the Imperial Capital... is that right?"</p>

            <p>"Yeah, that should be okay. As Otto said, we have the highest combat power."</p>

            <p>The strongest three from Emilia's faction, Emilia, Garfiel, and Roswaal are banding together, and it can be said to be the best performance as allies.</p>

            <p>Subaru and Beatrice, and Spica - there was concern whether these three would not act as a drag.</p>

            <p>"So Halibel-san is joining us as well. And then--"</p>

            <p>"--Subaru."</p>

            <p>Subaru was summoned by the one man who was not included in the list of members just mentioned. This man was undoubtedly someone Subaru wanted to join the strongest members. However, the plainly-dressed man declared with his stern gaze steady.</p>

            <p>"I will stay by Lady Anastasia's side. Drawing the enemy's attention to the fortress city will also facilitate your infiltration," he said.</p>

            <p>"-----"</p>

            <p>"Of course, the emperor's confidants will take over the defense of the city, but I plan to assist as well. Above all..."</p>

            <p>He paused his words and turned his gaze to Anastasia standing beside him.</p>

            <p>Anastasia had uncomfortably rushed to Vollachia to look for the disappeared Subaru and the others. Subaru expressed his gratitude and emphasized the necessity of returning her safely.</p>

            <p>Therefore, the man---Julius flatly stated, "I am Lady Anastasia's Number One Knight."</p>

            <p>Subaru took a quiet breath at those words. He understood them as both a declaration of Julius's position and a challenge to Subaru, who held the same position.</p>

            <p>---Just as Julius vowed to protect Anastasia, so was Subaru expected to guard Emilia.</p>

            <p>"Just so you know, staying here doesn't mean we have it easy. If you let your guard down, we'll have a repeat of the humiliation we faced during the raid."</p>

            <p>"That is dreadful. Even now, looking at my facial wound in the mirror makes me tremble."</p>

            <p>"You jerk!"</p>

            <p>Laughing off Julius's casual joke, Subaru briskly stood up.</p>

            <p>Then he looked around and reiterated, "It's me, Betty, and Spica. We will also have Emilia, Garfiel, and Roswaal. Halibel is also a new addition to our group."</p>

            <p>"Hmm, let's do our best. Ram and the others who stay behind, please be careful of the 'zombies.'"</p>

            <p>"When Emilia and the others, who are launching an attack on the main fortress, say that, I have no words. But, the difficulty for Emilia and the others can be influenced by how flashy an attraction we can make here. It's an opportunity to show off my skills."</p>

            <p>Anastasia responded with a mischievous smirk, as if the merchant spirit within her was sparked.</p>

            <p>Feeling reassured, Subaru clenched his fist in preparation for the looming decisive battle against the empire.</p>

            <p>"We must do everything in our power to prevent 'The Great Disaster'. It is crucial that we rush to the Imperial Capital. Because—"</p>

            <p>"—If Ceci we left behind carelessly kills thousands or tens of thousands, and then the mana of the Great Spirit is drained, leading to the fall of the empire, it would be a disaster."</p>

            <p>In that case, it would be hard to distinguish whether it was Subaru who brought Cecilus's fault, or it the empire's consequence for ignoring Cecilus until today.</p>
