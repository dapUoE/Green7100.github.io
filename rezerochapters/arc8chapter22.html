            <p>"Emperor Vincent, may I have a moment?"</p>

            <p>Hearing a voice from behind, Vincent Vollachia came to a stop. Even before turning around, he knew who the voice belonged to. He never forgot a voice or a face he'd once encountered. The voice belonged to a peddler with blond hair and blue eyes - Flop O'Connell.</p>

            <p>"Unfortunately, we're in the midst of a crisis threatening the Empire's existence. I don't have time to engage in idle chatter."</p>

            <p>He knew who it was, but Vincent was not inclined to entertain Flop. He needed to discuss the oracle just received from Ubilk the Star Reader, with Berstetz, Celine, and others about how to handle it. While they had Groovy as the designated countermeasure against the enemy, relying on him was irrational at its peak considering he could be dead by now. In that regard, it would be less absurd to have hopes on Natsuki Subaru, who was headed to persuade the other person named in the prophecy.</p>

            <p>To begin with, Vincent didn't see how he could convince the girl. Even a proper communication with her seemed difficult. As long as his play did not work on the girl, it made sense to let Subaru catch one of the two lights. Thus, all Vincent could do was contemplate practical strategies---</p>

            <p>"Whoa, whoa, you can't tell if it's idle chatter until you hear it out, can you? You wouldn't know what kind of story I have up my sleeve, even with your wisdom, dear Emperor!"</p>

            <p>"You..."</p>

            <p>As Vincent tried to resume his walk, Flop reached out, grabbed his shoulder, and held him back. It was an act of recklessness so profound that it could only be called sheer madness. Considering the situation, it was an act tantamount to asking for Flop's head to be chopped off instantly.</p>

            <p>"Let go of me right now, or you'll lose your life."</p>

            <p>"Of course, I would like to tell you right away too. However, I need some time to properly tell the story. It won't be quick."</p>

            <p>"I didn't ask you to speak, I asked you to let go--"</p>

            <p>"Come on, don't be like that, Abel-chin. Just go along with what uncle has to say."</p>

            <p>"What!?"</p>

            <p>As he glared at Flop, hand still on his shoulder, another voice came from in front of him. Suddenly, hands were sliding under his arms and lifting his body, an act of violence that entirely caught him off guard. Holding their breathes, the two speaking were the bright-eyed Medium O'Connell and her sibling, Flop, both their smiles enveloping Vincent from either side.</p>

            <p>"Abel, you've been avoiding big-brother all this time, haven’t you? Big-brother is so bruised and battered he can barely stand! Instead of being mean, listen to his story, okay?"</p>

            <p>"Don’t talk nonsense. How long will you continue to interact so casually with me? When the situation changes, the status changes too. It’s not like we’re in the Shudrak village or the castle city anymore."</p>

            <p>"Well, Abel, you may be playing emperor, but I think it’s wrong to disregard us like that! Am I right, big-brother?"</p>

            <p>"Yeah, sis!"</p>

            <p>The stubborn siblings didn’t lend an ear to Vincent's words.</p>

            <p>At the high-spirited sister's call, a vigorous response from Flop, who then opened the door of the adjacent room. Medium ushered Vincent inside, the door closing behind.</p>

            <p>Quickly taking the Emperor hostage, it was there that Medium finally released Vincent.</p>

            <p>"Do you realize that this is a brutal act that not only affects you two but could implicate your entire family?"</p>

            <p>"Ha, ha, ha, ha! Too bad, dear village head. Our family consists only of us brothers and sisters. So, your threat doesn't scare us!"</p>

            <p>"But, what about the kids at the orphanage, big-brother? Even if we're not blood-related, those who fled are still our family!"</p>

            <p>"Ha, ha, ha, ha! Once you mention it! Village head, I wonder what we should do to get your forgiveness!"</p>

            <p>"---Release me immediately and stay quiet."</p>

            <p>Regardless of the circumstances, the O'Connell siblings’ behavior did not change.</p>

            <p>It was Medium, with her stretching ability, and allegedly injured Flop, that were now under suspicion.</p>

            <p>Normally, if one's body seems to shrink, it would put a huge strain on the mental state, yet Medium seemed too ignorant of its effect.</p>

            <p>Flop too, despite being heavily injured, appeared hale - although the blood veins in his neck, and his pale, nearly whitewashed face, were concealed with makeup.</p>

            <p>"The appearance of a merchant is often just as important."</p>

            <p>"------""Normally, the golden rule of business is to buy and sell what is desired, but I'm afraid I can't meet your current request, village chief. I don't want to put this off any longer."</p>

            <p>"What are you talking about..."</p>

            <p>"I'm just the messenger. It's a message from the person who was playing the emperor instead of you."</p>

            <p>Vincent's eyes slightly widened, anticipating more nonsense. The message that the O'Connell siblings had chosen to convey to Vincent, even going so far as imprisoning the emperor in an empty room—it was only given to one person in this world.</p>

            <p>Therefore...</p>

            <p>"You should listen to his words, village chief. No, Emperor Vincent Vollachia," Flop said, revealing a serious expression for the first time. Vincent did not choose his words to dispute him.</p>

            <p>△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>"The Archbishop of Gluttony, Louis Arneb."</p>

            <p>When Subaru acknowledged it aloud, he heard a loud creaking sound inside his chest. It was like a forbidden box that always within reach but he had been hesitant to open. Like Pandora's Box, always able to be opened if he so chose.</p>

            <p>"----"</p>

            <p>Deciding that the hallway was not the place for their conversation, Subaru and his group rented out a large guestroom. Abel had thoughtfully suggested they use it if necessary—it was a rare consideration of human feelings from him. Of course, it made sense given that this matter could be a matter of great importance for the empire.</p>

            <p>In that guestroom, members of the Emilia faction gathered: Emilia, Beatrice, Otto, Garfiel, and Roswaal. Additionally...</p>

            <p>"The Archbishop of Gluttony... Frankly, it's a little too common for us to be dealing with."</p>

            <p>Anastasia quietly muttered, resting her hand on her cheek. She and Julius, who stood silently by her side, were also essential participants. It was not simply because they had crossed the border to help Subaru and the others, but because they too were victims of 'Gluttony'.</p>

            <p>"The important one, Louis, is currently with Rem. Everyone except Anastasia and Julius probably already know about Louis..."</p>

            <p>"Of course, dear. When I first learned of it, I was utterly shocked."</p>

            <p>"That makes two of us."</p>

            <p>Beatrice's assertion that she was surprised, Subaru thought, was likely quite an understatement. In reality, when Subaru first realised that he had been transported alongside Louis, his sole desire to protect Rem led him to adopt a rigid stance. Initially, this caused Rem to regard him with caution, deeming him a man who could not be trusted.
            
            Subaru did not know the circumstances under which Emilia and others had encountered Louis, yet it wasn't hard to imagine that their first encounter had been fraught with discord.</p>

            <p>Still, he was grateful that no one had resorted to extreme measures.</p>

            <p>"You all held up well. Otto and Garfiel, in particular, seemed ready to explode at any moment," he said.</p>

            <p>"Indeed, our views really only boiled down to banishment or restraint," replied Otto, "She only managed to avoid those outcomes because Emilia-sama persuaded everyone."</p>

            <p>"Emilia did…"</p>

            <p>As expected, Otto turned out to be one of the advocates for the radical measures, but it seemed that the more moderate Emilia was able to defuse his fiery disposition.</p>

            <p>In response to Subaru's words, Emilia gave a short nod, "Medium-chan tried really hard to protect that girl… Louis. I thought, this child is cherished by so many people around her. That's why it was so frightening to make any decisions right there on the spot."</p>

            <p>"I see, Medium…"</p>

            <p>Hearing that Medium had protected Louis, Subaru felt a faint sense of relief. Louis had always taken a shine to Medium, who was always bright and very caring. However, when Louis's identity as a Sin Archbishop was revealed, Medium too was among those who feared her.</p>

            <p>This was the last contact Subaru had seen of the two back in the Witch's Capital, Chaosflame. But if Medium had come to Louis's defence afterwards, there must have been some change in feelings that Subaru was unaware of. That was a heartening thought.</p>

            <p>"I have had a similar experience. A terrifying existence, believed by all to be a witch... I was left all alone, unable to talk to anyone. That's why…"</p>

            <p>"In Emilia-sama's case, it was irrational prejudice against half-elves," interrupted Otto. "Her case is different. It's a clear distinction imposed by her own actions."</p>

            <p>"Otto..."</p>

            <p>When Emilia began to justify her decision to side with Louis in addition to defending Medium, Otto interjected sharply. It was clear he did not hesitate to declare his stance as an ally of Emilia and, at the same time, a foe of Louis.</p>

            <p>"Remember, our journey so far has only been on hold until a final decision can be made."</p>

            <p>"May I say something?"</p>

            <p>The person who raised his hand in ease amidst the tension brought about by Otto's declared stance was Roswaal. As Subaru urged him to speak with his gaze, Roswaal closed his blue eye,</p>

            <p>"Myself, Ram, and Lady Anastasia joined the group later. Ultimately, we don't know how the girl named Louis behaves... is there anything suspicious? Surely, Garfiel has been keeping his eyes, ears, and nose open, right?"</p>

            <p>"I haven't been sparkling all over the place! B-but, Otto-bro and I agree on this. That's why we kept an eye on her from the moment we ran into her until the big fight..."</p>

            <p>"So in the end, you came up empty-handed. Then, on what grounds do you conclude that the girl is a dangerous Sin Archbishop?"</p>

            <p>"It's Beatrice and me. We had contact with a girl called Louis Arneb, the "Gluttony," in Priestella. She gouged my foot, so I won't forget it."</p>

            <p>Roswaal, as the representative of those who had little connection with Louis, spoke, with Garfiel and Otto expressing their respective views. Otto, who had touched his own foot, was reminded of the injury that had caused his temporary absence from the frontlines - a reasonable explanation why he was particularly wary of Louis.</p>

            <p>"I'm sorry to follow up after the Margrave, but may I also speak?"</p>

            <p>As Roswaal's question was digested, Julius joined the discussion one after the other. From the beginning, he had a hard look on his face while discussing "Gluttony," and now he glanced at Subaru who seemed even more troubled.</p>

            <p>"I would like to confirm, the girl named Louis who is riding in this dragon carriage, there's no mistake that she's Louis Arneb, the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony right?"</p>

            <p>"—? What do you mean by that?"</p>

            <p>"Both Lady Emilia and Miss Ram should know this. "Gluttony" could change her own appearance to that of the person whose powers she swallowed. In other words..."</p>

            <p>"So, this Sin Archbishop of Gluttony and the Louis that Emilia and the others are talking about are not the same person - they might be in a relationship of eater and eaten?"</p>

            <p>At Julius's speculation, Emilia and the others made surprised faces, going "ah".</p>

            <p>Considering the nature of "Gluttony," it should not be considered an impossible notion. If the archbishop had the ability to reproduce the forms of those it consumed, then the existence of the original victims would make sense, accordingly.</p>

            <p>If that were the truth, it would be possible to separate the existence of "Gluttony" from that of Louis.</p>

            <p>However...</p>

            <p>"...No, that line of thinking is not possible. Louis is likely reproducing the abilities of whoever she's consumed. That must be the result of the authority of "Gluttony"," Subaru discontentedly shakes his head.</p>

            <p>"Is that so? I apologize for just causing confusion," Julius closes his eyes and offers an apology.</p>

            <p>He is not at fault. If his conjecture was correct, it would have saved Subaru a lot of trouble. However, excuses won't work in this situation.</p>

            <p>What is required is not an answer based on shared truths.</p>

            <p>With Subaru, Louis was sent to the Vollachian Empire. Despite being treated harshly by Subaru, she struggled many times to aid him, risking her life and getting wounded in the process.</p>

            <p>If she is indeed Louis Arneb, the Archbishop of Gluttony, it is necessary to have everyone acknowledge that she is necessary for the upcoming battle.</p>

            <p>"...First, allow me to explain in order. Before Emilia-tan met up with Louis, what was it like when I, along with Rem, was carried off to the Empire, living alongside Louis."</p>

            <p>"...."</p>

            <p>Everyone's gaze focused intensely on him. Despite facing his trusted companions, Subaru felt a certain suffocation. The ordeal he faced was beginning to feel like a combination of grading and cross-referencing.</p>

            <p>This was for Louis truly being accepted by the group, for the sake of their verification.</p>

            <p>"Subaru, take your time," Emilia softly spoke to the tensed Subaru. Beside him, Beatrice also gave a nod of assent, gently holding Subaru's hand.</p>

            <p>Encouraged by their kindness, Subaru took a deep breath and began to speak.</p>

            <p>"At the very beginning, when we regained our senses, we were near a large forest far to the east..."</p>

            <p>△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>Telling his story as simply and concisely as he could, he chose his words in the most understandble way possible.</p>

            <p>Even so, the events he had to describe flowed out like a spring, ceaselessly. Despite the story only spanning a short time, the days were rich and intense.</p>

            <p>In the first place, a tremendous amount of trouble had occurred in just a brief span. Every single incident was a life-threatening disaster for Subaru and Rem, and their companions, naturally drawing in Louis as well. It was only natural—yes, it was only natural. After all, Louis had constantly been with Subaru's group, receiving kindness from Rem while drawing the ire of Subaru, still she continued to follow Subaru, who shunned her. Therefore...</p>

            <p>"Louis and I worked in coordination with Yorna-san to win our duel against Olbart-san. That was through a game of hide-and-seek-turned-tag, with the employment of a cheat technically,”</p>

            <p>"..."</p>

            <p>"I heard about the horrendous event that took place after that in Chaosflame. The inhabitants luckily survived and joined the rebel forces led by Abel. I lost consciousness there, got separated, after that... everyone else should know more about what happened to Louis, right?"</p>

            <p>"...Yes. We tended to Abel's return crew at the badly damaged Guaral, which happened immediately after that."</p>

            <p>Emilia nodded in agreement to Subaru's confirmation, and after quickly summarizing his point, he let out a long sigh. He had intended not to prolong this discussion, but it ended up lasting for almost an hour. Throughout all of this, he was grateful that his companions listened intently, hardly interrupting him. He strived to explain his point of view as objectively as possible in circumstances where he could not avoid being subjective.</p>

            <p>"And as I was saying, while she was with me, Louis didn't exhibit any suspicious behavior. I believe you can get the same answer from Rem too."</p>

            <p>"I haven’t doubted that. If Ram truly suspects something, she would not have allowed Louis to be near Rem."</p>

            <p>Ram, being part of the family and especially because this concerns Rem, her scrutiny is unquestionable. In fact, Ram had once overpowered "Gluttony" Lye Batenkaitos in the Pleiades Observatory, in large part because someone interfered with her relationship with Rem and herself. Ram, who did all this for her sister, whom she can't even remember. It was clear that if Ram had sensed any danger in Louis, however minute, she would never have let Louis be with Rem, who was just on the verge of awakening.</p>

            <p>"We... understand to a large extent what kind of hardship you have been going through, Natsuki-kun."</p>

            <p>Anastasia, who had been quietly listening until now, rubbed her brow with her fingers at the conclusion of Subaru's recounting of his relentless journey. Even for a woman as astute as her, it was a vast amount of information to digest. Trying her best to comprehend it all, Anastasia let her finger slip from her brow and said,</p>

            <p>"I am curious about what happened to you, Natsuki-kun, after you lost consciousness in the witch's city, but that's not our primary concern right now.</p>

            <p>"Yeah, what's important is Louis," Subaru acknowledged, "As I've said, Louis hasn't shown her dangerous side to us yet. Plus, Ubilk's Stargazing prophecy...that's another thing. Henceforth, I expect Louis to cooperate in our fights—"</p>

            <p>"To what end, though?" Anastasia coolly interrupted, halting Subaru's words in their tracks.</p>

            <p>She traced her lips with the finger she had used to massage her brow, ensnaring Subaru with her intellectual, teal-colored eyes, and then spoke.</p>

            <p>"Natsuki-kun, I don't necessarily mind your propensity to make use of anything and everything. Meili, whom we used to cross the Augria Sand Dunes, was originally an enemy too. If we're talking in those terms, it should apply to her too, right?</p>

            <p>"Surely, Louis is in the same position as Meili?" Subaru responded.</p>

            <p>"No, she's not − everyone but you would think so."</p>

            <p>"..."</p>

            <p>At her quietly firm reply, Subaru quickly glanced around. He surveyed the faces of everyone but himself, as Anastasia had pointed out. He hoped someone would refute Anastasia's claim.</p>

            <p>However, no one met Subaru's expectation.</p>

            <p>"Everyone..." he murmured.</p>

            <p>"I'll say it because nobody else wants to," Otto offered, raising his hand amid the fallen silent, strained faces of the group, his own countenance barely changing.</p>

            <p>The lack of change in his expression, however, meant that he retained his composure from the start of the meeting. His gaze and voice were not unconditionally on Subaru’s side.</p>

            <p>"I agree with Anastasia-san. The circumstances differ for Meili and her. They're not on the same level."</p>

            <p>"Otto!"</p>

            <p>"I'll say it because no one else wants to. It's because she's a Sin Archbishop."</p>

            <p>Subaru, unable to control his voice, evoked a calm response from Otto. His preemptive answer was the most fitting reason why none of the others could side with Subaru at the moment.</p>

            <p>"Subaru, Betty wants to be on your side. I wonder if she can believe that the girl... That little Louise, is not malicious now. But..."</p>

            <p>"The reality is that we too have suffered at the hands of the Gluttony. Considering its subtle manifestations, I wonder how numerous the potential victims might be"</p>

            <p>"We may have no way to verify it... but the regrets of those who lost themselves, forgotten by others, left stranded without any place to lean on and unable to return, are more than palpable to me"</p>

            <p>Beatrice, trying to be considerate towards Subaru, was followed by words from Roswaal and Julius. These were the genuine opinions of the victims of the Authority of Gluttony and those affected directly by that damage.</p>

            <p>"----"</p>

            <p>Just as Roswaal and Julius said, it was somewhat better when you knew you had been the victim. The truly desolate part was knowing that many victims who had their "names" and "memories" stolen, lost their homes, and hadn't been saved, must exist. And, that the Archbishop of Gluttony, who created so many such victims--</p>

            <p>"Everyone, they just can't believe it"</p>

            <p>"Emilia...."</p>

            <p>"That's not it... I think they just can't forgive it"</p>

            <p>It wasn't that Subaru was lacking in explanation, or that his feelings didn't reach. It wasn't about that, and Emilia's words, with a downturned brow, shattered Subaru's heart. Those who knew the story of Subaru's time with Louis, and what happened after he was gone - Emilia and the others, they perfectly understood that "this" Louis wasn't a threat to them. Even with that understanding, the real problem laid with the "past" actions of Louis.</p>

            <p>"---- What she has done, will never disappear"</p>

            <p>"--- huh?"</p>

            <p>Anastasia murmured softly. This reminded Subaru of the cold, crumbling desperation she had once warned him of. The implications of her words were now solely in Subaru's recollection, but with a change of circumstances, they found a way once again from her lips to Subaru's ears.</p>

            <p>"Even if Natsuki-kun insists that this child is harmless, it doesn't make up for the times when she was harmful. The victims are still victims... this is not a shallow issue that can be covered up with pretenses,"</p>

            <p>"——"
            
            "First, shouldn't she return all the 'names' and 'memories' she's eaten so far? Even Natsuki-kun would find it hard to agree if we proceed without doing that, right?"</p>

            <p>Anastasia's razor-sharp words were cutting into the tense Subaru. Each one a just argument, the sharpest pain came from her last point — that they had no foundation to decide Louis's treatment without her returning the stolen 'names' and 'memories'. This was the big premise leading to what Emilia meant by 'unforgivable'.</p>

            <p>"Also, Subaru-kun's prophecy heard by his royal majesty too. It's not realistic to not have this girl named Louis assist in the fight."</p>

            <p>"Huh? What are you trying to say? Speak clearly."</p>

            <p>"While I do mind recieving your frustration... our policy of making the girl cooperate won't change no matter how our discussions end. The only thing left is, her treatment."</p>

            <p>"Treatment...?"</p>

            <p>Subaru's heart was racing as Roswaal continued to speak in roundabout ways, even after being told to speak clearly. Noticing Subaru's desperate look, Roswaal nonchalantly followed up. That was,</p>

            <p>"It's about how we should convince her to cooperate. For instance, we could promise to give her a pardon once we overcome the crisis —. And once everything is over, we'll carry out a punishment that matches her crime. This ought to be the cleanest method."</p>

            <p>"——Are you kidding me!"</p>

            <p>At Roswaal's malicious plan, Garfiel bit back, grinding his teeth. He directed his fierce gaze towards Roswaal,</p>

            <p>"Even if our opponent is nefarious, it doesn't mean we have to be too! Making her help us by dangling an empty promise, I ain't gonna approve of that!"</p>

            <p>"Oh really? I thought it was what Otto-kun was thinking too..."</p>

            <p>"Don't lump Otto-bro in with you!"</p>

            <p>"——. What Roswaal is suggesting, is likely the stance of most people. That the Archbishop of Sin should not be pardoned. Or maybe..."</p>

            <p>At that point, Otto cut his words and looked at Subaru intently.</p>

            <p>In his sight that made Subaru hold his breath, he mercilessly continued, "Is Mr. Natsuki trying to set a precedent where Sin Archbishops can be pardoned?”</p>

            <p>"––Damn it, that wasn't what I meant. The world is home to certain villains that should not be forgiven. That includes the Witch Cult's Sin Archbishops too."</p>

            <p>Petelgeuse, Regulus, the brothers Lye and Roy, Sirius, Capella – all the Sin Archbishops Subaru encountered before were beings that were exceedingly far from the norm. Those who would not hesitate to sacrifice others to satisfy their own desires.</p>

            <p>Yet––,</p>

            <p>"––Does she, does Louis Arneb fall into a different category?”</p>

            <p>"That, is…"</p>

            <p>Otto's question assaulted the depths of Subaru's heart. Sin Archbishops must not be forgiven. This line that everyone, not only Otto, had drawn was something Subaru understood well. Nevertheless, to want to make Louis an exception is, as Otto puts it, absurd.</p>

            <p>"……"</p>

            <p>Under the gaze of everyone around, Subaru questioned his own heart once again. What did Subaru want to do with Louis? He had harbored intense hatred for her in the Corridor of Memories, he had made the choice not to save her while she suffered from the after-effects of Return by Death. He didn't see those decisions as mistakes. Even if faced with the same situation, he would make the same decisions.</p>

            <p>But at the same time, he knew the Louis who had shared hardships with him in the Vollachian Empire. He had repeatedly seen the fact that she risked her life and actually lost it to help Subaru, which was etched into his soul. Like this, Subaru's vigilance against Louis was gradually dissolved––,</p>

            <p>"Why?"</p>

            <p>"……"</p>

            <p>Suddenly, a quiet question was thrown towards Subaru's profile as he was lost in thought. When he opened his eyes, he was met straight on with the purple eyes of Emilia who had posed the question. She narrowed her eyes framed with long eyelashes and repeated the same question one more time.</p>

            <p>That was-</p>

            <p>"Why did Subaru become able to think that way?"</p>

            <p>"Why, you ask…"</p>

            <p>"Subaru, weren't you the one who greatly despised the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony? The 'I can't forgive him' mindset. So what about now?"</p>

            <p>"That is, didn't I just talk about it? She... Louis was, with all of us in this Empire-"</p>

            <p>Having gone through many hardships together, Louis valiantly tried to protect Subaru and Rem. Just as he had been seen as an unforgivable enemy in the "Corridor of Memories", the events in the Empire left a devastating impact on Subaru. Hence, the feelings of Natsuki Subaru toward Louis started to change.</p>

            <p>"Subaru, let me tell you a cruel truth once more."</p>

            <p>Responding hesitatingly to Emilia's question, Julius announced in a low voice. The fact that he deliberately prefaced it as cruel made Subaru tense up. To that tensed Subaru, Julius traced the scar under his left eye with his finger and said,</p>

            <p>"The people of this world will never forgive the "Gluttony" Archbishop, the girl named Louis Arneb. Regardless of the kingdom or the empire, one might say it's a consensus of the world. "</p>

            <p>"------"</p>

            <p>"No matter where in the world she tries to flee, there will be no place where she can be forgiven. If one commits a crime, they will be punished. And the sins of the archbishop can only be atoned for through death."</p>

            <p>It was a cruel fact indeed, there was nothing false about that statement. With a clear, strong tone, Julius stated categorically. There is no place in this world where Louis Arneb can live and be forgiven.</p>

            <p>Faced with this heavy truth, Subaru was left speechless.</p>

            <p>Howeverー,
            
            "I too, desire nothing but death for an Archbishop. Death to the entity considered our world's enemy. That's the best I can say."</p>

            <p>"……huh?"</p>

            <p>"Julius Juukulius!!"</p>

            <p>The one who sharply raised his voice and glared at Julius was Otto.</p>

            <p>Ignoring Subaru, whose eyes had widened, unable to digest the added words, Otto and Julius exchanged piercing glances. Julius was in pain, while Otto looked bitter, both shooting hurtful glares.</p>

            <p>"You're an outsider, it's absurd for you to speak about such matters....!"</p>

            <p>"I'm sorry, but your understanding seems correct. I am also one of the concerned parties. Allow me to exercise my right to voice my opinion."</p>

            <p>"---tch"</p>

            <p>Otto gnashed his teeth and glared even more fiercely at Julius. Even though he knew that he couldn't compete with Julius in terms of physical strength, Otto didn’t step back. Julius, slightly squinting one eye at Otto's strong resolve, sighed lightly.</p>

            <p>"Death… for the Archbishop…"</p>

            <p>Off to the side of their confrontation, Subaru muttered that with a part of his brain feeling numb.</p>

            <p>Julius had begun to say something, and the perceptive Otto had snapped back so sharply. Something beyond their words, something Subaru hadn't quite grasped, was hidden there.</p>

            <p>The world demanded nothing less than the death of the Archbishop of Sin. Louis Arneb will not be forgiven by the world.</p>

            <p>The world would never forgive the Archbishop of Sin, Louis Arneb or--</p>

            <p>"Ah,"</p>

            <p>"Subaru, let's discuss about Betty's story."</p>

            <p>A faint gust seemed to blow through the maze of his thoughts just as Beatrice spoke.</p>

            <p>She looked up at Subaru, her unique and distinctively patterned irises focused on him and said,</p>

            <p>"Betty had encountered Louis, the Archbishop of Sin, in Priestella. After that, she ran into her again in the Empire and thought something about her seemed different... As if she was a different person."</p>

            <p>"......"</p>

            <p>"The Louis I saw is not the Archbishop of Sin that Betty knows. I want to know Subaru's perspective. How did the Archbishop of Sin seem to you, having stood so close?"</p>

            <p>Beatrice's gentle yet probing words left Subaru no escape. He understood what she was alluding to. It was something he had refused to acknowledge for a long time.</p>

            <p>The current "Louis," now, seemed like a different individual altogether compared to the Louis Arneb he'd met in the "Corridor of Memories".</p>

            <p>However, as he had argued against Julius's assertion, "Louis" was able to use the Authority. Like "Gluttony," she was controlling the Unique Abilities of her prey at will.</p>

            <p>While "Louis" possessed the Authority of "Gluttony," only her mind seemed to have been reborn.</p>

            <p>Had it been like when he lost his own memories, like--</p>

            <p>"Like when I lost all my memories."</p>

            <p>If that were the case, had "Louis" suffered much?</p>

            <p>Like how Subaru had chased the phantom of "Natsuki Subaru," torn between trusting or doubting everyone around him, had "Louis" been reaching out for help?</p>

            <p>Even amidst such circumstances, "Louis" had helped Subaru and Rem, bringing them to this day.</p>

            <p>And then--</p>

            <p>"I've been thinking about it for a long time. If you do something wrong, is it impossible to make amends forever?"</p>

            <p>"Emilia..."</p>

            <p>"If you apologize, repay, and still get rejected, there will be times when you hate to even apologize or pay back, right? So, I've been thinking of ways to prevent that... But, I haven't been able to find an effective method. However,"</p>

            <p>"However?"</p>

            <p>"There might be one way. The way Subaru taught me."</p>

            <p>Emilia placed a hand over her chest, selecting her words with all the emotions she could muster. Hearing her words, Subaru searched within himself. But nothing that Subaru had taught Emilia came to mind in this moment.</p>

            <p>Looking at the perplexed Subaru, Emilia spoke with gentle eyes,</p>

            <p>"More than finding it hard to forgive someone, it's about hoping they find happiness."</p>

            <p>"-----"</p>

            <p>"The thought of wanting many people around to be happy. I think to forgive that child, we need to have such thoughts", she gently revealed.</p>

            <p>Emilia's words slowly and quietly seeped into Subaru's heart.</p>

            <p>The way to forgive a villain. The way to forgive wicked actions. She talked about seeking redemption, atoning and apologizing. Even the desperate answer they came up with seemed to mirror these thoughts.</p>

            <p>But Subaru couldn't quite grasp what he had supposedly taught her or when he had shared such wisdom with her..</p>

            <p>Yet, he felt her words landing solidly in his heart.</p>

            <p>Why was Subaru so distressed over the "Sin Archbishop" and "Louis"?</p>

            <p>Because Louis did something for Subaru that went beyond what was done to Louis.</p>

            <p>Therefore-----</p>

            <p>"I'm gonna have this conversation again."</p>

            <p>Hearing Emilia's words and Subaru's faint sigh, Anastasia said so. She was stroking the collar of her fur while alternately looking at Subaru and Emilia.</p>

            <p>"---Where are we planning to end this conversation?" she asked.</p>

            <p>△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>"Hmm?"</p>

            <p>In front of her, Rem let out a long sigh while holding the cheeks of Louis, who was curiously peering into her face. Louis, whose cheeks were still held, made an even more puzzled face at Rem's reaction. From this young girl's response, Rem realized she was causing worry.</p>

            <p>Having reflected on that------</p>

            <p>"Haa…."</p>

            <p>"You sigh so melancholically, Rem. What's wrong?"</p>

            <p>"Sister...."
            
            As she sighed deeply, a gentle voice reached her from the side.</p>

            <p>It was Ram, who had returned to their assigned room after preparing tea. She was followed by a young girl with antlers sprouting from her back—her name was Tanza, if she remembered correctly.</p>

            <p>Noticing Rem's gaze, Ram nodded, "Ah," and said, "I brought her along because she seemed to have nothing to do."</p>

            <p>"It's not that I had nothing to do..."</p>

            <p>"Really? You seemed unhappy to be separated from the other noisy ones. It seems even in the Empire, there are those who want to fight to protect women and children. I thought you were more foolish."</p>

            <p>"But, sis, that's a bit harsh..."</p>

            <p>Rem's cheeks flinched slightly at her sister's blunt words. It would take a bit more time for her and her sister to fully digest their situation, but the cries from the depths of their souls were honest, and she found her heart being shaken by their every move.</p>

            <p>Aside from that, Tanza did seem unhappy, following Ram's suggestions.</p>

            <p>"Yes, there are many in the warband, led by Lord Cecilus, who tend to think simply, but there are also those, like the governor, who are sharp-minded."</p>

            <p>"Is that so. So you're staying put because the sharp-minded governor told you to."</p>

            <p>"...No, it was Lord Shwartz who told me to rest. "</p>

            <p>"Hmm."</p>

            <p>Tanza stiffened slightly at the edges of her mouth in response to Ram's retort. Immediately, Louis, whose cheek was pinched by Rem, groaned as she felt the strength of her hand.</p>

            <p>"I'm sorry, Louis. I got carried away. Are you okay?"</p>

            <p>"Ugh...ugh?"</p>

            <p>"...No, it's not related at all."</p>

            <p>"Ugh..."</p>

            <p>As Louis looked doubtfully at Rem's answer, which she gave while pinching his cheek. As she was taking her gaze off Louis, she met eyes with Ram, who was just finishing her tea. She put a cup of warm, fragrant tea in front of Rem and said,</p>

            <p>"Even as a secret imperial dragon chariot, it's not stocked with much tea. It may not be anything special, but it should warm you up."</p>

            <p>"Thank you. I'll have some."</p>

            <p>"So? Did Barusu do anything rude to you?"</p>

            <p>"Splutter!"</p>

            <p>Just as she had freed Louis's cheek and put the tea to her mouth, she spat it out in surprise at Ram's words. As she hastily set down her cup, Louis tried to wipe her face with his sleeve.</p>

            <p>"It's okay, it's okay, Louis-chan.... Um, what is it, Sister?"</p>

            <p>"There is no 'what is it'. Subaru's actions are often rude and insensitive. There is a high chance that he is the reason for Rem's gloomy face, even if it was a random guess."</p>

            <p>"That's a bit of an overstatement..."</p>

            <p>Upon realizing that her sister's deduction was merely a random guess, Rem, whose face had been wiped by Louis, let out a relieved sigh. However, Ram, who was good at reading people's reactions, seems to have guessed why she had sighed.</p>

            <p>Ram sat cross-legged directly in front of her, tilting her cup as she watched Rem intently.</p>

            <p>Under that silent pressure, Rem quickly confessed, "About Emilia-san..."</p>

            <p>"About Emilia-sama? Yes, Emilia-sama can also be ignorant and impetuous. So that's why Rem's face was darkened."</p>

            <p>"N-No, not like that! I just wondered... what's the relationship between Emilia-san and a man named Natsuki Subaru..."</p>

            <p>Lowering her voice, Rem succeeded in asking the question as calmly as possible.</p>

            <p>However, she had not noticed that her topic of conversation was enough to make Ram squint her light red eyes.</p>

            <p>Her intelligent sister murmured a small 'I see,' and said, "Yes, we should tear Subaru apart. Let's do it together later."</p>

            <p>"Sister!?"</p>

            <p>"Hehe, it's a sisterly collaboration. Even Subaru can be useful sometimes."</p>

            <p>Her sister was so beautiful when she smiled faintly, yet her words were incredibly alarming. Hearing Ram's words, Tanza literally got ticked off.</p>

            <p>She took a sip of the tea she had made herself, and was surprised at the taste, "Isn't that a little reckless? If you are referring to Lord Schwartz as Subaru, neither I nor the members of the corps will tolerate any harm towards him."</p>

            <p>"That's a brave answer. ...Tanza, how old are you?"</p>

            <p>"Erm... I'll turn twelve this year."</p>

            <p>"Ah, I see. Understood."</p>

            <p>"Just because you've reached a conclusion doesn't mean we have."</p>

            <p>Rem agreed with Tanza's dissatisfied opinion.</p>

            <p>Why did Ram, after hearing Tanza's age, seem to have reached an understanding? In the first place, Ram has not answered Rem's question at all.</p>

            <p>What is the relationship between a woman named Emilia and Subaru?</p>

            <p>"...They seemed extremely close to each other."</p>

            <p>Should someone ask, Rem could only offer a quizzical 'huh?', but there was definitely something strange about the proximity of the two. Regardless, Rem wanted to quickly resolve whatever their situation was so she could focus on her own matters. Her issues, indeed, Rem's problems were—</p>

            <p>"They are just that, Rem's pressing concern."</p>

            <p>"That's right. It's a trifling matter that I want to settle swiftly so I can address a much bigger problem at hand. It's not more or less than that."</p>

            <p>"—Rem, can I have a moment?"
            
            "Huh!?"</p>

            <p>With a sudden clatter, Rem abruptly stood up in surprise. Her rapid movement accidentally jostled Louis, who was sitting on her lap, causing Rem to lift her into her arms hastily.</p>

            <p>As Louis let out a startled "Aou?!", Rem apologized while turning her gaze towards the direction of their knock.</p>

            <p>"Who is it?"</p>

            <p>"Who else could it be other than Barusu dismembered into eight pieces...? I wonder if the discussion is over."</p>

            <p>"Aah..."</p>

            <p>Rem let out a small sigh at the words of Ram, who was elegantly savoring her tea. She hugged Louis tighter as he tilted his head questioningly. Burying her nose in his golden hair, Rem closed her eyes.</p>

            <p>She had attended the meeting when their convoy was attacked, but did not participate in the subsequent conversation led by a grave-faced Abel with Subaru.</p>

            <p>Of course, there was the part where she couldn't offer any significant contribution to the important discussions. And then, there were also the minor doubts she had confirmed to herself a while ago.</p>

            <p>But the prime reason was...</p>

            <p>"Huh?"</p>

            <p>The circumstance with Louis, who was cradled in her arms, was the cause of an unpleasant turmoil stirring in her chest.</p>

            <p>Even though she couldn't define it, Rem intuitively felt that she needed to stay by Louis's side. Hence, she retired to her chamber and...</p>

            <p>"––– If you please, Sir Schwarz."</p>

            <p>"Ah, thank you. ....Wait, so you're here too, Tanza."</p>

            <p>"Yes. Everyone, in collusion with you, has dumped me with the housekeeping duties."</p>

            <p>"What a guilty way of putting it...."</p>

            <p>As Rem was taken aback, Tanza ushered the visitor into the room in her stead.Upon entering, the visitor scratched his head in embarrassment as Tanza lashed out in resentful tones. Despite shrinking in size, the troubled air around his face didn't change in the slightest.</p>

            <p>It's probably because his face still retained somewhat of its childlike features, even as he had grown taller.</p>

            <p>"Despite his bad eyes, he's a strange man."</p>

            <p>"Huh!? Did someone just insult my eyesight? I heard that!"</p>

            <p>"Heh. Quite something, isn't it? Complaints from the citizens of the Lugnica Kingdom have traveled beyond the borders."</p>

            <p>"There's no way the whole kingdom is talking about my eyes! They must be talking about happier things, like what's for dinner tonight or plans for tomorrow!"</p>

            <p>Subaru, responding dramatically to Ram's teasing, stumps into the room.</p>

            <p>Somehow, Rem was unable to meet Subaru's gaze and hid her face behind the Louis she was holding, avoiding looking straight at him.</p>

            <p>Instead, Louis did the job for her and entertained Subaru with a soft, "Uah-uah."</p>

            <p>"Hey, Louis, I had some business with you too. You know where Rem is?"</p>

            <p>"Aa-uu."</p>

            <p>"I see. You don’t know either. That's a shame, I wanted to have a serious talk."</p>

            <p>"――If you want to have a serious talk, stop fooling around and get to the point."</p>

            <p>"Wow, Rem! You were hiding behind Louis! I didn’t notice!"</p>

            <p>Subaru reacted exaggeratedly and obviously to Rem's interjection. However, Louis seemed to buy into this exaggerated reaction and sadly dropped his shoulders, disappointment visible that he couldn't hide Rem properly.</p>

            <p>Putting Louis down on the floor and gently patting her head to comfort her, Rem watched with narrowed eyes.</p>

            <p>"......You're not overdoing it, are you?"</p>

            <p>"――――"</p>

            <p>"I've told you before, please stop overdoing things and taking on reckless challenges. You're not a hero who can do everything."</p>

            <p>She echoed the same words she had told him before, seeing Subaru's most recent behavior, it seemed like he was putting on a brave face.</p>

            <p>Upon hearing her words, Subaru's eyes widened momentarily, before he let out a wry smile.</p>

            <p>"No, actually, objectively speaking I'm Superman. I'm grateful to hear your opinion, Rem, and I'll just take it as your cute way of saying things."</p>

            <p>"Please stop kidding around."</p>

            <p>"I'm not. ――Rem, there's an important matter about Louis."</p>

            <p>Subaru's gaze became serious as he adjusted his posture and erased his wry smile.</p>

            <p>As Rem caught her breath at his words, Ram, who had been observing their exchange from the side, sighed,</p>

            <p>"Barusu, shall Ram and I leave the room?"</p>

            <p>"'Ah, it's nice to have both my sister and Tanza here. My sister serves as the representative of the sisterhood, and Tanza is the representative of the loli department.'</p>

            <p>'Ah, so you mean I'm superior to Frederica as a sister. Of course,' a declaration filled with confidence came from Ram.</p>

            <p>'Um, what does "loli department"... mean?' Tanza tilted her head in confusion at the request.</p>

            <p>Upon the request, Ram puffed out her chest, and Tanza tilted her head.</p>

            <p>Then, Rem gently drew in Louis to face Subaru again. In that moment, she held the back of Louis' head into her chest, while attentively examining Subaru.</p>

            <p>And then he said...</p>

            <p>"Let's settle this. This loving relationship of ours that I don't really get."</p>
