            <p>With a sword in one hand and luggage tucked under the other arm, he slowly opened the door before him. He didn't kick it down or slash it open. Making reckless noise could alert the lurking undead, known as the Corpse Soldiers, a situation best avoided. It would draw the attention of others too.</p>

            <p>A mere encounter with the common imperial soldier turned undead was still to be preferred over clashing with a skilled one, particularly while burdened with indispensable luggage.</p>

            <p>"———"</p>

            <p>He scrunched his nose, his face twisting at the metallic rust scent wafting from the room. It was the smell of blood. With familiarity came the ability to discern its freshness. This scent was of blood, recently spilled, and not that of just one person's.</p>

            <p>As expected, upon checking the room further back, he found two bodies lying on top of each other.</p>

            <p>They were in a civilian home facing the main street, left behind were the corpses of an old woman and a man.</p>

            <p>The perpetrator was most likely the Corpse Soldier he had cut down just moments before, in front of the house. Its sword, wet with blood, was due to its recent creation of these bodies.</p>

            <p>The victims were probably parent and child, he mused. Sadly, their final expressions weren't peaceful enough to compare their features. The old woman was found in her bed, and next to the man who had collapsed as if to cover her, a broken sword lay scattered.</p>

            <p>"They were too late to escape... No, that's not it."</p>

            <p>It wasn't that the two had been too late to escape, more likely the son had stayed to protect his mother, who couldn't flee.</p>

            <p>Such a natural realization was bitterly ironic, given that it occurred in the heart of Vollachia Empire's capital, which normally considers trampling the weak as normal.</p>

            <p>However, he couldn't find amusement in that irony. If only he had arrived a few minutes earlier.</p>

            <p>"———"</p>

            <p>Silently, he sheathed his drawn sword and gazed upon the body of the man who had decided how to use his life amidst an unavoidable tragedy.</p>

            <p>If he were placed in the same situation, protecting the bed of his beloved family behind him, could he fight until his last breath like this man?</p>

            <p>"Pathetic. I already know the answer."</p>

            <p>He spat out an irritated sigh with a bitter aftertaste that just wouldn't leave. Yes, he already knew his own hypothetical answer. After all, he was the kind of person who would definitely flee with tail between his legs. And that was when he sneered at himself.</p>

            <p>"Hey, redhead! Where are you at?! My business is done here!"</p>

            <p>Suddenly, an absurdly loud voice reached him from outside the building, causing him to glance reflexively towards the window. He pictured the flushed-red face of his separate-action companion and sobered up as he considered the recklessness of shouting in a city infested with Corpse Soldiers.</p>

            <p>He had tried to drown out the heavy reality with drink after drink, nearly losing himself in drunken stupor, yet the realization struck him like a punch to the head as he leaned out of the window with a click of his tongue.</p>

            <p>Below in the street, a blue-haired man was looking around, waving his hand as if searching. Not alone, a smaller figure dressed similarly stood beside him.</p>

            <p>"Where might you be, father's companion?! It's hard to have a proper conversation here; wouldn't it be better to find a more conducive spot, if the story about a companion you blabbered about when drunk wasn't just a delusional rant or nonsense?!"</p>

            <p>"Whoa there, quite the thing to say. Capture the parent and talk like that, how unfilial you turned out to be. Where did I go wrong in raising you…"</p>

            <p>"No, no, father! It's not your fault at all! After all, you hardly raised me!"</p>

            <p>The noise of the two together was more than just doubled. Even though what intoxicated them differed—one alcohol, the other himself—they were both undoubtedly drunkards. Listening to their voices, Heinkel—whose empty hand went to his head—realized he was being sought out by them.</p>

            <p>Throbbing painfully, his headache from the hangover was aggravated by reasons beyond just alcohol, while the emergency ration werewolf child he was carrying under his arm fidgeted and he let out a deeply alcohol-tainted sigh.</p>

            <p>△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>The two fools continued causing a commotion right on the main street, not caring about being seen. Heinkel, unwilling to be dragged into a swarm of Corpse Soldiers by their antics, quickly beckoned the two over.</p>

            <p>Along with bringing the two inside the house, an unexpected extra had come with them.</p>

            <p>"I never thought I'd find you still in the imperial capital, Heinkel. I figured you'd have fled long ago, or otherwise..."</p>

            <p>"Dead, you were going to say? I'll send those same words back at you, Aldebaran."</p>

            <p>"Just Al, if you please."</p>

            <p>The reunion with the man in the iron helmet, Al, was unexpected. He fiddled with the clasps on his helmet as he responded. Heinkel, who had been assigned to a different battlefield from Priscilla and Al during the all-out war between the regular army and the rebels, had been unaware of how the fight ended or their well-being.</p>

            <p>He had no way to know the answers, which surprisingly, now had been delivered to him.</p>

            <p>And that was—,</p>

            <p>"That Priscilla lady's been captured, huh? Hard to believe."</p>

            <p>"Well, the princess sure does have a knack for diving into unexpected turns of events, but even I can't let this one go this time around. So, that's why I stayed in the capital... But then, you ran into that, didn't you?"</p>

            <p>At Heinkel's words, Al bobbed his head with a "yeah" affirmation. Al's tired voice and atmosphere, hidden behind the iron helmet that concealed both his facial expressions and complexion, hinted at the extent of his recent struggles. For Al, who could even tolerate the unruly and wild Priscilla, this current state must imply a terrifying adversary.</p>

            <p>Yet, the one who wore Al out to the point of exhaustion was an odd coincidence indeed.</p>

            <p>"I certainly never thought I would run into father here of all places. I was wondering why I hadn't seen you around, so I suppose you threw me into the "Gladiator Isle" for some legendary adventure, father?"</p>

            <p>Rapid-firing his words, the Wosso boy—who had claimed the name Cecilus—nibbled on dry meat he'd taken without permission from the house's storage. Shockingly, the boy turned out to be the son of Rowan, whom Heinkel had traveled with. And as if the joke couldn't get any stranger, the boy's full name, including the house name, was—,</p>

            <p>"—Cecilus Segmunt. The 'Blue Lightning' of Vollachia."</p>

            <p>Vollachia Empire's greatest swordsman and the steadfast "First" amongst the Empire's "Nine Divine Generals."</p>

            <p>Heinkel, despite his own state of decay, was the deputy commander of the Lugunica Royal Guard. He was familiar with the names of notable figures from the neighboring country, especially the overly famous "Blue Lightning."</p>

            <p>The single person who had claimed most lives in the bloody history of the Empire, considered equal to the Kingdom's "Sword Saint" in strength.</p>

            <p>"———"</p>

            <p>Narrowing his eyes at Cecilus, who appeared to be about eleven or twelve, Heinkel inwardly mocked himself for underestimating the boy's competence due to his youth.</p>

            <p>True strength, he knew, makes concerns about appearances and age utterly ridiculous and humiliating.</p>

            <p>Heinkel had lost to his son, Reinhard, in a sword battle for the first time, even before Reinhard had turned six years old. --In this world, there exist such beings. To Heinkel, rather, it was Rowan who should be recognized as a rare opponent.</p>

            <p>Rowan too, just like Heinkel, labeled as the strongest, even if thoughts about his son Cecilus's swordsmanship and reputation crossed his mind--.</p>

            <p>"Ha ha ha, thanks for the laugh. The sword duels on that isolated island are just a spectacle, no matter whom and how many you cut down, there's no learning in your sword or techniques. Throwing you into such a place is nothing but a detour from the path to the 'Heavenly Sword.'"</p>

            <p>Disregarding the thoughts that rose within Heinkel, Rowan shrugged his flushed face and put his lips to a gourd filled with sake, talking cheerfully with his son.</p>

            <p>At Rowan's response, Cecilus, while tearing into dried meat, turned his head without any hint of anxiety, "Is that so?"</p>

            <p>"Well, I did think it was an odd approach for father to take. But now it makes it all the more mysterious why I was on that island in the first place, a truly inexplicable mystery."</p>

            <p>"That's quite the bizarre idiom you've got there. In any event, it was my doing that you were there... Hmm?"</p>

            <p>Cutting off his words mid-sentence, Rowan suddenly scrutinized Cecilus from head to toe.</p>

            <p>Noticing his father's intense gaze, Cecilus fluttered the sleeves of his wasou and twirled around, spreading his unmanageable long blue hair.</p>

            <p>"What's the matter? I would think my brilliance as a star actor is not easily forgotten, even if it's been a while."</p>

            <p>"Nevermind that, wait, my son! Where did you put Murasame and Masayume? Those are fine blades, not to be carelessly removed from your side."</p>

            <p>"A blade, you mean? What are you talking about? It's an unspoken agreement between father and me that we won't carry a sword until we find one befitting. Unfortunately, I've yet to encounter a sword worthy of the name, so my waist remains light. Flippantly so."</p>

            <p>"Hmmm?"</p>

            <p>With even more suspicion clouding his eyes, Rowan stared at Cecilus, who was making gestures of having an empty waist.</p>

            <p>After a moment, as if something clicked, Rowan's eyes widened.</p>

            <p>"Somethin's fishy here, Cecilus, you've shrunken in height, haven't you!?"</p>

            <p>"You're only noticing now!?"</p>

            <p>Al, taken aback by more surprise than Rowan's astonished face, raised his voice.</p>

            <p>Beside him, Cecilus himself made an oblivious face, "Shrunken?" Heinkel too, understood nothing of it.</p>

            <p>Instead, Al, who seemed to have an idea, closed the distance to Rowan and pressed,</p>

            <p>"Just to clear things up, you're Cecilus's father, and the Cecilus you know is rightfully an adult, yeah?"</p>

            <p>"Wait a minute, Al. Who exactly can say when a person becomes an adult? For example, isn't it absurd not to treat someone as a full-fledged person when they kill someone for the first time—otherwise wouldn't it mean the person who got cut down was only half baked..."</p>

            <p>"Shut up right now! What do you say, father?"</p>

            <p>"There's no need to press me so hard, fine knight. In a parent's eyes, no matter how much a child grows, they're still classified as children. Besides, that Cecilus never grew up even with time passing..."</p>

            <p>"I've had enough with your insistence that you two are father and son..."</p>

            <p>Brushed off by both the closing-in Rowan and the bystanding Cecilus, Al stomped the ground in frustration.</p>

            <p>Feeling sorry for Al, Heinkel roughly ruffled his own red hair and said,</p>

            <p>"So, what you're trying to say, Aldebaran, is that this Cecilus Segmunt has somehow shrunken and turned into a child?"</p>

            <p>"Al. ...Well, yes, I do know the reason and the way to return him back, but yes, that's the situation."</p>

            <p>"People shrink and I'm supposed to nod along as if it's normal. Ridiculous, but considering the anarchic scenes I have witnessed in the imperial city's battle, I can accept most situations."</p>

            <p>"If there is a way to return him back, there is no need for much fuss."</p>

            <p>"I would gladly return him to normal, but to do so, we need a certain elderly shinobi. So for now, we’re stuck as is... Why didn't you notice your son shrunk with your first glance?"</p>

            <p>With a loose shake of his head, Al turned the conversation to question Rowan.</p>

            <p>However, in response to the query, Rowan traced his stubbled chin with his finger and mused,</p>

            <p>"To me, whether my son is big or small is a trivial matter."</p>

            <p>"Hey hey, what is this, the worst father contest? Are all the strongest fathers in the world like this?"</p>

            <p>"--How about you? Are you aware that you've shrunken?"</p>

            <p>Unabashedly, Rowan answered with the air of a father far from exemplary, to which Al grumbled in dismay. Hesitating to respond to that grumble, Heinkel turned to Cecilus.</p>

            <p>At that, Cecilus who was tackling his third slice of dried meat, laughed, "Indeed."</p>

            <p>"As far as awareness goes, none at all! Whether I shrink or grow, I'm still me on the stage!"</p>

            <p>"Is that so..."</p>

            <p>"However! But! What the boss, Gustav, and everyone on the island along with all the other minor characters mentioned, it all starts to add up! This is foreshadowing being resolved!"</p>

            <p>Slapping the nearest table energetically, Cecilus's voice rang out.</p>

            <p>While it seemed Cecilus had comprehended something, to Heinkel, who was only following the conversation, it was all complete gibberish. It was clear that neither father nor son was taking the considerable matter of shrinking too seriously.</p>

            <p>"However, it makes sense now. No wonder there was a calmness in contrast to when I faced myself. After all, the manner of our parting was what it was."</p>

            <p>"Hoho? I have no recollection of what kind of farewell occurred between father and me—"</p>

            <p>Stroke his chin pensively, Rowan's comment made Cecilus furrow his brow in thought.</p>

            <p>Given the exchanges so far, imagined Heinkel, their parting seems to have been not a good one.</p>

            <p>Then--,</p>

            <p>"--That piece of garbage, is the man who tried to assassinate His Excellency and got cut down for it."</p>

            <p>A sharp voice interrupted, turning the gazes of Heinkel and the others in its direction.</p>

            <p>Just then, the small bearded dog-man, who had been fast asleep until moments ago, sat up from where he laid on the floor. Eying Rowan with a sulky expression as he sat cross-legged, he growled:</p>

            <p>"The dead bastard's alive after all, what a goddamn surprise. And that idiot Cecilus messed things up; can't believe it."</p>

            <p>"Ah, you're awake, little dog. Woof woof, you seem lively as ever, which is good to see."</p>

            <p>"You're a damn fool yourself, damn it!"</p>

            <p>At the bearded dog-man's raised voice, Cecilus twisted his lips in a pout, indicating familiarity between them. Nonetheless, it seemed Cecilus had forgotten him. No, given the flow of their conversation, it would be more accurate to say he had forgotten everything that happened before he shrank.</p>

            <p>It's an odd thing, but perhaps because he has forgotten his adulthood, his conversations with both Rowan and the dog-man are not aligning.</p>

            <p>"Speaking of which, who's this energetic fellow you've put to sleep here?"</p>

            <p>"Ah, the gentleman with the fluffy coat there is Grand General Groovy. One of the 'Nine Divine Generals' of the Empire, and a colleague of Cecilus."</p>

            <p>"Groovy? You mean Groovy Gumlet!"</p>

            <p>Surprised by the unearthed identity, Al's voice rose in astonishment, and Heinkel felt an equal sense of shock.</p>

            <p>After all, during the journey, Rowan had only told them about the importance of the person they were transporting as luggage, without offering further details.</p>

            <p>Depending on the circumstances, such luggage could inadvertently become a shield against an attack by the undead.</p>

            <p>"So, two generals are here though one has shrunken. Well, this could be an unexpected ray of hope..."</p>

            <p>"――? Why would that be?"</p>

            <p>"Didn't a general just say something outrageous? That he plotted the assassination of the Emperor?"</p>

            <p>When Al steered the conversation back, the focus shifted again to Rowan. For a moment, the awakening of Groovy and Cecilus's interaction had drawn their attention, but indeed, he had said so.</p>

            <p>Confronted with these suspicions, Rowan clapped a hand to his forehead, exclaiming:</p>

            <p>"As far as that goes, there's been a misunderstanding. I never planned the assassination of our great Emperor. I merely... tried to make my son do it."</p>

            <p>"...That doesn't sound like an excuse. So, you and your son are both would-be assassins of the Emperor?"</p>

            <p>Unable to serve as a proper defense, Heinkel looked at the blue-haired father-son duo with stunned disbelief.</p>

            <p>Since there wasn't a report of the Emperor's death, it would seem the attempt failed, but it was nonetheless a scandalous affair.</p>

            <p>However, to Heinkel's surprise, Groovy shook his head and said:</p>

            <p>"The shit here, he told the Emperor that his shitty old man was plotting that. Then, he spoiled the old man's rotten scheme and tried to finish him off himself."</p>

            <p>"But he didn't succeed, so he's still alive, right?"</p>

            <p>"Why that happened, I don't fucking know! Hey, you little shit Cecilus! Why the hell did you let your rotten father live?!"</p>

            <p>"Who knows? Whatever I may have done, yesterday's me, today's me, and tomorrow's me—my inspirational thoughts and grand directing differ in each moment. But it's unlikely that I failed, so perhaps it was all intentional?"</p>

            <p>Confronting Cecilus who had sprung to his feet, the boy of similar height waved his hands dismissively as if to indicate the answer was lost in his height.</p>

            <p>In fact, persisting in questioning a Cecilus who likely couldn't remember the reason would be futile. Instead—</p>

            <p>"Blue hair, why did you even plot to assassinate the Emperor? To overturn the state?"</p>

            <p>"Ha ha, Red hair, what madness do you speak? The objective is profoundly simple—if word got out that the Emperor is threatened, then all the Empire's forces would be hostile towards my son."</p>

            <p>"That would, indeed, be the case, wouldn't it?"</p>

            <p>"That is my aim. An environment where my son would engage in swordplay in the thin line between life and death, with the Empire's soldiers relentlessly pursuing him without care for sleep or feast—there's no better!"</p>

            <p>"..."</p>

            <p>Rowan clapped his knees as if boasting a brilliant idea, leaving Heinkel completely unable to comprehend the reasoning, staring at him fixedly. Cecilus, upon hearing this, exclaimed "Ah, I see!"</p>

            <p>"So that's why! Father would make me do that indeed, for the sake of reaching 'Heavenly Sword.' He wouldn't choose the means to achieve it!"</p>

            <p>"Your talent with the sword is real... Yet, you hit a wall just before 'Heavenly Sword.' Perhaps, in a parent's heart, this was necessary to break through forcefully."</p>

            <p>"Ha ha ha, parental love is unlike you! If my father still retained such a human emotion, he wouldn't have killed five or six children before the talented me was born."</p>

            <p>"There's no argument there!"</p>

            <p>Laughter echoed from the parent and child who seemed to have resolved a big question.</p>

            <p>While Groovy looked on with a grimace and Al rested a hand on his neck, listening, Heinkel felt a wave of dizziness as if the ground was shaking and bumped his shoulder against the wall.</p>

            <p>The parent-child relationship made no sense to him.</p>

            <p>He was struggling to understand what could drive someone to such lengths. The fleeting sense of empathy he had felt towards Rowan dissipated quickly—the empathy towards someone who was said to be the strongest, just like him, a father's empathy for his position.</p>

            <p>Heinkel couldn't fathom why Rowan, who plotted and nearly got assassinated by his child and was treated as dead with the worst infamy, could still laugh so carefree.</p>

            <p>Back home, Heinkel too was in a similar position, yet he found it unbearably suffocating.</p>

            <p>To be unjustly suspected of kidnapping royalty was intolerable enough—</p>

            <p>"――We've both got our troubles, I get that much."</p>

            <p>Heinkel's dizziness went unnoticed as Al spoke softly.</p>

            <p>He too likely had many thoughts about the parent-child conversation earlier and Groovy's situation, but he swallowed them all and put a lid on his emotions.</p>

            <p>That's because Al had something in mind that he prioritized over the immediate confusion of the scene.</p>

            <p>"All of us here have something or a purpose we're looking for in the imperial capital. It's not like we need to borrow anyone's hand; we might be a bunch of capable fellows, but there's no reason to refuse cooperation, right?"</p>

            <p>With that question, Al glanced around at the faces in the room.</p>

            <p>At Al's invitation, Groovy crossed his short arms and puffed out his chest, declaring:</p>

            <p>"I just woke up, and all I know is that the capital smells like fucking dirt. I'll be damned if I'm left behind with this idiot and his even stupider father. Especially since I can't figure out what the highly intelligent Emperor is plotting."</p>

            <p>"Seriously, our first priority is to drive away the dead, enemy or ally alike... You're on the same page with that, right?" Al looks around at his comrades, seeking confirmation.</p>

            <p>"Don't give me that crap worry, we're on the same page," Groovy retorted with a rough snort, lending a coarse agreement to Al's opinion. Afterward, Al glanced over at Cecilus and said, "I get that you and your old man have a... unique father-son relationship. I don't get how you can laugh together knowing what's behind it, but feeling choked up about parents is something we have in common. I won't pry. Instead—"</p>

            <p>"There's no need to worry or pick your words so cautiously, Mr. Al. In the recent battle against the archer, we were saved by your judgment. So! I believe there's no need for me to diverge from Mr. Al's strategy or go my own way for the time being," Cecilus interrupted with assurance, sparing Al the need to continue.</p>

            <p>"That's a relief. And while you're at it, spare me any whimsical attempts on my life. One can never have too many lives."</p>

            <p>"Ha ha ha, never have too many lives! Nice joke!"</p>

            <p>"It's not a joke," Al sighed, responding to Cecilus's amused laughter and thumbs-up.</p>

            <p>Shifting focus, Al then vainly attempted to encompass Heinkel and Rowan within his gaze, asking, "What about you, old man? What's your move?"</p>

            <p>"Oh, Sir Helmet! How gravely you invite us compared to your tone with the son and the furball... That's bound to hurt a person's feelings," Rowan quipped, both impersonating and mocking the seriousness in Al's approach.</p>

            <p>"Right now, my impression of you is pretty damn awful, just so you know," Al flatly expressed his sentiments to Rowan with a shrug of his one-armed shoulder and turned to address Heinkel, "You didn't shine in that last all-out war, but saving the princess here could make up for that. Your wish can't come true without the princess, right, Mr. Heinkel?"</p>

            <p>"I..." overcome with conflicted emotions and biting his back teeth, Heinkel lowered his gaze.</p>

            <p>Indeed, Heinkel's alignment with Priscilla's camp hinged on a sought-after reward, achievable only through her triumph in the royal selection. In truth, no expectations were set on Heinkel's own contributions or capabilities; his role was merely to serve as a deterrent to Reinhard, who sided with another candidate.</p>

            <p>Contemplating this, it meant that no matter Heinkel's efforts here for Priscilla, it would only be an atypical accomplishment, divergent from his actual role.</p>

            <p>And yet...</p>

            <p>"――――"</p>

            <p>There had been a moment on the battlefield where Heinkel had bent his knee, ready to abandon the struggle, his spirit nearly broken upon witnessing a scene that seemed to overturn the heavens and earth. ――Heinkel had contemplated surrendering.</p>

            <p>He left the battlefield, drowned himself in alcohol, dragged along by Rowan, and closed himself off to everything.</p>

            <p>Still, a thought lingered.</p>

            <p>"......Louanna."</p>

            <p>Humiliatingly, his heart yearned for a second chance when given the opportunity to redeem himself. If Priscilla had not seen his flight or his resignation, then perhaps he could have concealed it, could have turned a blind eye to the fear that had passed, and still reached out.</p>

            <p>"But, what can we do? The five of us, heads together. Do you think we're able to save an empire on the brink of destruction with just us?"</p>

            <p>"It's a quite outrageous statement. Indeed, we may seem like only five people at a glance, but the potential power within us is worth more than a hundred people each, millions when added together, so it's not just—"</p>

            <p>"Shut your damn mouth."</p>

            <p>Amidst inner conflict, Heinkel sought a perspective on their chances. Cecilus's nonsensical quip was swiftly silenced by the experienced Groovy. Even as Groovy stifled Cecilus while saying, "Still—" he too addressed Al, acknowledging, "Shit-talking Red's got a point. No matter how many idiots like us are here, slaughtering all those bastards out there won't be easy."</p>

            <p>"I personally think we shouldn’t do that. Call it the lead actor's intuition!"</p>

            <p>"Shut your damn mouth!"</p>

            <p>As Cecilus and Groovy started bickering like they were trying to plug a leaking ship, Heinkel's doubts remained unresolved. Truth be told, his heart was somewhat decided. If he didn't have to give up, he wouldn't. He just needed a reason now.</p>

            <p>With a demand for such a reason weighing on him, Al flicked the metallic clasp of his helmet and said, "Mr. Heinkel's right, flipping the situation with just the five of us is indeed too ambitious. So, what we need to do isn't some grand deed like saving the empire. ――We're going to pave the way."</p>

            <p>"Pave a way, you say?"</p>

            <p>After licking the sake within his gourd and wiping his mouth with his sleeve, Rowan inquired to Al, who simply nodded.</p>

            <p>Al's gaze drifted, captured the closed window—beyond it lay the capital, now a city of the dead.</p>

            <p>"Saving the empire is the work of a hero. Our job is to lay the groundwork for that. As much as possible, haphazardly, since we don't know what might prove useful."</p>

            <p>Struck by Al's words, which carried a hint of conviction, Heinkel blinked in response. It sounded like Al knew someone capable of pulling it off, though Heinkel clearly had no such connection, and presumably, neither did Rowan or Groovy.</p>

            <p>However, one exceptional being lit up at these words,</p>

            <p>"――In other words, foreshadowing!!"</p>

            <p>Cheerfully excited by the prospect, the youthful "Blue Lightning" jubilantly embraced Al's strategy.</p>

            <p>Given the dynamics present, it did not take long for these five gathered individuals to adopt this as their collective resolve.</p>
