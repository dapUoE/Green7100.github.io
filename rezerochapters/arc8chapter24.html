            <p>"---Spica, huh."</p>

            <p>A voice muttered while observing the sobbing pair, Rem, and the girl who had been Louis till this point.</p>

            <p>Wiping her tear-streaked face with the back of his hand, Subaru who had turned to look, met Ram's gaze, she who had voiced the remark. As usual, she bore a calm demeanor, her cheek rested on her hand against the table, her long legs crossed over each other.</p>

            <p>Tilting her small head, she narrowed her pinkish eyes at Subaru and asked,</p>

            <p>"And the origin?"</p>

            <p>"....It's the name of a star. At least, in my home town."</p>

            <p>"I see. It‚Äôs poetic even for you, Barusu. But do you understand?"</p>

            <p>For the entire duration of their conversation leading up to entering their quarters, with her eyes still narrowed, Ram directed her gaze towards the embracing pair. Subaru immediately understood what Ram was trying to say.</p>

            <p>A conversation that had more or less been continually exchanged before entering the quarters.</p>

            <p>"Do you understand what it means to use the Archbishop of Sin just because it serves a bigger purpose?"</p>

            <p>"---. Of course, I considered it. I can't be so presumptuous as to claim that I understand though..."</p>

            <p>"Then, stop."</p>

            <p>"---"</p>

            <p>Confronted with her cold, harsh words, a small groan escaped Subaru's throat.</p>

            <p>Ignoring Subaru's reaction, Ram's unyielding gaze urged on more sternly.</p>

            <p>"If you do not properly understand, then stop. ---The meaning of confrontation, and this very eye."</p>

            <p>As she said this, Ram stretched out the hand that was propping her cheek, reaching out and touching the slender shoulder near her.</p>

            <p>Near Ram, there was Tanza, who had been watching the interplay between Subaru and others. Tanza who had been requested to serve as a witness and was present here.</p>

            <p>She blinked her almost completely black eyes at Subaru's gaze and said,</p>

            <p>"Lord Schwartz, I understand your feelings very well. You've pushed through many unreasonable situations, be it at Guninhive or the journey afterward. But..."</p>

            <p>"Tanza."</p>

            <p>"But, even for Lord Schwartz, who managed to bring Sir Cecilus, I think it's not advised to invite the Sin Archbishop."</p>

            <p>Tanza raised her wavering eyes at Subaru, looking up at him with resolute determination. Without resorting to pleasing melodies or flattering words, she gave voice to her own honest opinion. Her opinion, though voiced out by the young yet earnest Tanza, indeed sunk into Subaru‚Äôs heart as well.</p>

            <p>"...Yes, I've been foolish."</p>

            <p>Accepting Tanza's words, he felt anew the truth in Ram's words.</p>

            <p>And that was the weight of the wrong choice Natsuki Subaru had decided to bear.</p>

            <p>"I understand perfectly. It's been told to me over and over again, I'll bear it all."</p>

            <p>"Right. I'll tell you this, no matter what Barusu or Rem might say, Ram won't forgive."</p>

            <p>"... Sister."</p>

            <p>"No, Rem. While your kindness makes me proud as your sister, this is a different story."</p>

            <p>Holding Spica tight, Rem looked at Ram with teary eyes. However, shaking her head at her sister's stare, Ram firmly declared her position.</p>

            <p>Of course it stands to reason. Ram too, was a victim of "Gluttony" who had her other half, Rem, taken away from her.</p>

            <p>She can't go so far as to say that her position is the same as Subaru's. She wont even entertain that thought.</p>

            <p>Therefore‚Äî</p>

            <p>"I'm not even standing at the entrance of such a wish for forgiveness. The only reason why I haven't shredded that girl... Spica to pieces yet is a matter of "memory", nothing more."</p>

            <p>"... If we don't know how to restore "memory" and something happens to Spica now..."</p>

            <p>"In case, just in case Rem's "memory" doesn't come back. Though Rem said it's fine even if she doesn't return, Ram won't allow it. I will make you remember, both for Rem herself and for how much Ram loved Rem."</p>

            <p>Ram declared her intent to restore their lost love, her conclusion the same as before.</p>

            <p>After the battle at Pleiades Watchtower concluded, with the death of Ley Batenkaitos and the successful capture of Roy Alphard, Roy, as a possible means to rescue the victims of the "Gluttony" authority, was spared his life.</p>

            <p>However‚Äî</p>

            <p>"The only difference is that compared to those Sin Archbishops, she is somewhat cooperative."</p>

            <p>"Ram..."</p>

            <p>"Stop that look on your face. Okay? If you want to be forgiven, start with atonement. Isn't that just common sense? Anyways, it would have to be said later."</p>

            <p>"‚ÄîSo it is."</p>

            <p>Nodding at Ram's words, Subaru placed his small fist against his own chest.</p>

            <p>Just as she said, the mercy that is currently given to Spica is generous postponement. Those who were involved in her case have extended the postponement of her punishment, based on her deeds and usefulness.</p>

            <p>All Subaru can do is to offer her name as a factor motivating her resolution to start life afresh and help as many people as possible agree to extend the postponement.</p>

            <p>"First off, Spica... Can't you simply use your Authority's power to restore Rem's 'memory' and 'name'?"</p>

            <p>"U-uh... Au..."</p>

            <p>"I suppose that would be too convenient...‚Äù</p>

            <p>Spica shakes her head apologetically at the man cradling Rem. She experiments by opening and closing her own hands, but manipulating the Authority and returning what the ‚ÄúGluttons‚Äù have taken does not seem to be a simple task.</p>

            <p>"Is... is Spica really capable of doing something like that? Restoring everyone‚Äôs lost 'memories'?"</p>

            <p>"At the very least, Spica has the highest likelihood of succeeding, and her being able to do so is a minimum requirement. That in itself is independent of the 'Stargazer' discussion."</p>

            <p>Rem is anxious, but she has to manage it somehow. That is a prerequisite necessary for Spica to bear the "cross" that is "Louis," and walk forward. For that, she has to master the "Gluttony" Authority...</p>

            <p>"......"</p>

            <p>"...Huh? Excuse me?"</p>

            <p>A momentary, transient anxiety silences Rem and shakes her eyes. The generosity proposed by Ram, the conditions necessary to receive it, despite understanding the method that must be cleared, the existence of the Authority is terrifying.</p>

            <p>In order to stop being the unforgivable Archbishop of Deadly Sins, by continually using the Authority employed by the Archbishop of Deadly Sins, the terror of approaching "Louis Arneb" again in the way of life called Spica.</p>

            <p>To keep Spica alive, that means continuing to fight that fear. Having made up her mind‚Äï‚Äï,</p>

            <p>"I need you to do it. Spica, I'm counting on you."</p>

            <p>"Uh! Au-au!"</p>

            <p>With a clear resolution in her blue eyes, Spica enthusiastically nodded in response to Subaru's words. She looked the same as the villainous "Louis Arneb," but there was something fundamentally different. That was surely a hope that could be firmly believed in.</p>

            <p>"Tanza, I'm sorry that I can't follow your warning."</p>

            <p>"‚Äî. Do you always think that I'll forgive you with a laugh?"</p>

            <p>Moving his gaze away from Rem and Spica, Subaru then turned to Tanza. To Subaru, who had spoken in a subdued voice, Tanza responded with a voice hard with emotion.</p>

            <p>In response, Subaru shrugged off his shoulders and said, "No, I don‚Äôt."</p>

            <p>"Because you rarely smile."</p>

            <p>"That's not what I meant...""I understand clearly. But, give me a chance," Subaru pleaded.</p>

            <p>"If you wish to do so, you should have many methods at your disposal. Just tell her that her power is for the Vollachian Empire, and in turn, for saving Lady Yorna," Tanza states firmly, her lips pursed tight.</p>

            <p>Regardless of the reliability of the "Stargazer‚Äôs" prophecies, Spica's presence is indispensable in this battle. When that is stressed, Tanza cannot refuse, especially with Yorna's life at stake.</p>

            <p>However, Subaru wasn't fond of that approach.</p>

            <p>"Maybe your crafty method could make Tanza yield, but I hate it. I don't want to use such underhanded tactics on anyone, especially you," says Subaru candidly.</p>

            <p>"‚Äï‚ÄïThen it's impossible for Mr. Schwarz, isn't it?" says Tanza, turning her gaze from Subaru as she hugs her slender arms.</p>

            <p>Faced with the accusation of being a coward, both in words and gestures, Subaru exhales deeply. What Subaru wants to do always ends up hurting those who cherish him.</p>

            <p>"So, what cunning tactics has your unscrupulous self deployed outside?" asks Ram in a pointed manner.</p>

            <p>At Ram's remark, Subaru gives a bitter smile. Ram is kind-hearted for not letting Subaru indulge in his self-deprecation. It would indeed be better if he could smoothly navigate as Ram suggested.</p>

            <p>"I haven't done anything so cleanly. The option to start over until I can get it right was there, but..."</p>

            <p>For instance, on the Sword Slave Island, Subaru could proceed without hesitation. When embarking down the wrong path, or unwanted relationships, he chose to reattempt corrections‚Äîan act of perseverance involving continuous trial and error.</p>

            <p>"But, I don't want to do that now that I've reunited with everyone," Subaru explains. While speaking, he ran his tongue inside his mouth, confirming the absence of the package of poison hidden long ago behind his molar and closed his eyes.</p>

            <p>If he ever had to resort to that method again, it should not be to evade the mistakes in his relationships. He strongly determined this in his heart‚Äï,</p>

            <p>"‚Äï‚ÄïMoreover, I've already been punched quite hard by Otto."</p>

            <p>He realizes that he cannot repeat the sacrifice his actions imposed on others.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center">‚ñ≥‚ñº‚ñ≥‚ñº‚ñ≥‚ñº‚ñ≥</p>

            <p>"Otto, let me heal ya. Show me your hand."</p>

            <p>As he spoke, Otto stared back at Garfiel, who was standing in front of him. The rough-looking boy had a very delicate interior contrary to his appearance. He was considerate and kind-hearted, truly a fitting member of Emilia's team.</p>

            <p>At Garfiel's offer, Otto just shook his head side to side, "No need to be so concerned. It's not that serious..."</p>

            <p>"But that's not like ya, Otto!"</p>

            <p>"---"</p>

            <p>"I've thought 'bout it and it's not like I'm not considerate myself. That's why, I think I'm getting the hang of your feelings, Otto."</p>

            <p>Scratching his head, Garfiel narrowed one eye and pointed his chin towards Otto's hand, which was the focus of his gaze; a severely bruised and swollen right fist.</p>

            <p>For a moment, he tried to hide it from Garfiel's sight by turning away, but it was reckless to try that with an able warrior like Garfiel, and most importantly,</p>

            <p>"Do ya really want to go into battle not treating that hand, brother?"</p>

            <p>"...When you put it like that, I have no objections, do I?"</p>

            <p>With a wry smile at his sound argument, Otto gave in, stretching out his right hand. The swollen, black and blue fist was throbbing with pain, and from his two decades of life experience, Otto felt the bone was probably broken.</p>

            <p>Rather, the moment he thought it was broken, the pain seemed to worsen. Whether it was broken for real or not, it felt broken.</p>

            <p>"It's like the 'first to die' among the weak Domus."</p>

            <p>"Do you mean typically weak people who charge unnecessarily into the battlefield and meet an unfortunate end?"</p>

            <p>"Well, ain't a weak-willed guy like you completely unrelated to that, Otto."</p>

            <p>As he said that, Garfiel started to cast a healing magic on the hand he gently took. The sensation was like being slowly warmed up in hot water, and after just a few seconds, the pain in Otto's fist subsided.</p>

            <p>"Since it's freshly healed, if ya gotta punch next, do it with your left hand."</p>

            <p>"I'd hate to break both hands. Next time, I'll count on you, Garfiel."</p>

            <p>"If I do it, it's gonna leave a big hole. You got off easy just because it's your own strength, Otto."</p>

            <p>Grinding his teeth, Garfiel looked around and went back to gaze at the wall of the carriage.</p>

            <p>As Garfiel had pointed out, there were indeed signs of a barely indented and fractured wall. The fist that made such a mark belonged to Otto, its height matching...</p>

            <p>"...the same height as our dear small-changed Captain,"</p>

            <p>"Natsuki-san was lucky to have been miniaturized. If I had punched him in that state, it wouldn't have mattered what excuse I have, I still would've looked like the bad guy,"</p>

            <p>"That ain't wrong. If the captain were full-size, I might've taken a swing at him after you,"</p>

            <p>Garfiel croaked out a laugh, going along with Otto's lighthearted quip. At his friend's antics, a smile broke across Otto's face. With his just-healed right hand, he ruffled his hair, cursing under his breath.</p>

            <p>His right hand, fresh from healing, still throbbed with pain when lashed about. But the pain was a relief.</p>

            <p>"Even if it's an easy way out, pain can be a cure... So, should I have punched Natsuki-san after all?"</p>

            <p>"Should I say, do you want to go punch him together now?"</p>

            <p>"No, thank you. If we go now, I'll end up seeing something I don't want to,"</p>

            <p>Garfiel, who was trying to cheer him up, groaned at Otto's refusal, at a loss for words. Otto reflected on how his actions unintentionally turned into a bout of displaced aggression. But was it truly unintentional?</p>

            <p>Could he claim with certainty that there was no intent to lash out at Garfiel, knowing he would not bite back, despite his caring nature?</p>

            <p>"‚Ä¶ I hate this,"</p>

            <p>With that mumble, Otto slapped his forehead with his right hand a bit harder than before. Both his forehead and his hand cried out in pain.</p>

            <p>As of now, Subaru should be in the guest room where the sisters Ram and Rem were waiting, facing off against "Louis" and engaged in conversation.</p>

            <p>The discussion to be had in there was something Otto profoundly disdained. If he was there, he would've loudly voiced how much he didn‚Äôt want to witness the scene. Emilia and Beatrice, more worried about Subaru himself rather than the flow of the conversation, went with him. They might not enter the room, but Otto could picture them nervously awaiting the outcome.</p>

            <p>However, considering that very predicament...</p>

            <p>"......"</p>

            <p>Garfiel, who remains silent with an awkward face, is likely staying in this situation out of concern for Otto. Both Emilia's group and Garfiel contribute to Otto's sour mood.</p>

            <p>Otto's consistent opinion towards the Archbishop of Gluttony, Louis Arneb, is that he must be eliminated at all costs. Because of this firm belief and determination, there is something Otto has deliberately concealed from Emilia's group.</p>

            <p>Since their reunion in the fortress city of Guaral, Otto has had several encounters with "Louis," a wordless girl, and never once perceived any malice from her.</p>

            <p>Otto's divine protection of "Soul Language" is quite simple: it allows him to communicate with any living being. His most commonly used function is to exchange words with ground dragons and insects, and gather information. However, if he so chooses, Otto could even converse with an infant.</p>

            <p>During his harsh life as a peddler, he would earn money by taking care of infants for local influential figures. Though the cries of a baby are not words, their intended meanings were discernible.</p>

            <p>Similarly, he could understand the intent behind the unspoken sounds made by "Louis." And within that, there was no malice towards others, mostly just affection towards Subaru and Rem. Thus, Otto hid this fact and absolutely did not tell Emilia's group.</p>

            <p>As long as there are suspicions, he could ensure that Emilia and the others maintain their distance from "Louis." When the suspicions are cleared, Otto did not need to explain how the kind-hearted Emilia and the others would react towards her, or how they would reach out to her. To him...</p>

            <p>"Otto-kun and Garf-kun, may I have a word?"</p>

            <p>Knock-knock, peeping through the lightly knocked guest room door was Anastasia dressed in a kimono. Next to her was Julius dressed in Wazow attire. At her appearance, Otto tightened his cheeks and nodded, "yes."</p>

            <p>"Because it looked like it will take a bit longer on that side, I thought it would be odd to wait in such a large group and came back. I was also worried about your hand, Otto-kun..."</p>

            <p>"There ain't no need for ya both to worry. As for Bro's hand, I was the one who healed it. Anyway...‚Äù</p>

            <p>"Yes?"</p>

            <p>"Having you call me Garf-kun just doesn't sit right with me," Garfiel grumbled, crinkling his nose.</p>

            <p>Anastasia's eyes widened at his complaint. Then, with a cheeky smile, she said, "Sorry, sorry! But see, because Mimi talks about Garf, Garf all the time, my head just went and adopted it. Garf-kun, not good with you?"</p>

            <p>"Don't think it is...," Garfiel grumbled in response.</p>

            <p>"Garfiel, you don‚Äôt need to worry about it," Otto said, shaking his head while patting Garfiel's reluctant shoulder.</p>

            <p>As Anastasia came in, Garfiel shifted his standing position, gradually moving Otto behind him. To be precise, it wasn't due to Anastasia.</p>

            <p>"-----"</p>

            <p>Julius, who was standing right next to Anastasia, was the reason. The moment he showed himself in the guest room, something in Otto's demeanor changed - something that Garfiel noticed.</p>

            <p>Because of his thoughtfulness, Otto nodded his approval.</p>

            <p>Then, standing next to his ‚Äòyounger brother', he gestured towards Anastasia's group with his right hand, "Just as Garfiel has mentioned, my hand has been healed."</p>

            <p>"Is that so? That's great. I was worried there and going to suggest Julius for healing, but it seems I was being overbearing," Anastasia replied with a smirk.</p>

            <p>Anastasia could be quite impudent. If she had suggested it, there was no way they could have said no, what a pity.</p>

            <p>During their absence from the Augria Sand Dunes, Otto and Garfiel might have deepened their friendship with Subaru and Emilia-Meili and others, but-</p>

            <p>"Unlike them, I remember that you two are our enemies," Otto said in a sharp tone.</p>

            <p>"---. You really are something, Otto-kun. Of course, I don't dislike Emilia and the rest...but if there wasn't this kind of response, I'd lose my competitive edge," Anastasia said, her voice as soft as her smile.</p>

            <p>Even though her expression and tone were gentle, the light in her sky-blue eyes was unyielding, and Otto knew he had hit the mark. Even though she had crossed the border to march into the Vollachian Empire, Anastasia had clearly drawn the line for her camp. Precisely for this reason, she had joined this dragon carriage as one who had greatly involved the city-state Kararagi.</p>

            <p>In this regard, it wasn't Anastasia who was the issue, but "Knight Julius".</p>

            <p>"I apologize for speaking out of turn earlier," Julius said.</p>

            <p>"An apology, you say?" Otto responded, his voice rigid. An exasperated sigh slipped out upon hearing Julius's response.</p>

            <p>Julius‚Äô overly outspoken remark must have been a comment he made during their earlier exchanges about the treatment of the "Gluttony" Archbishop.</p>

            <p>In expressing his thoughts, Julius merely exercised his right to do so. Those words, as they should have been, were prompted by his own infuriated self at the situation.</p>

            <p>"Do you mean you've reconsidered? And indeed, you are an outsider?" Otto asked.</p>

            <p>"No, as a victim of the Authority of the 'Gluttony' Archbishop... I am implicated. I have a brother who can't revisit those memories. From this point of view, I can't consider myself an outsider," Julius replied.</p>

            <p>"...Then, on what basis did you overstep?" Otto inquired softly, his eyebrows furrowed. Despite professing an apology, Julius suggested he didn't intend to adjust his stance on the issues that Otto had been grappling with. One could hardly think of why else Julius would wish to apologize.</p>

            <p>"Sincerely, I apologize. I took over your role, Otto," Julius confessed, his yellow eyes filled with sincere regret and a degree of trust in him.</p>

            <p>"‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

            <p>"Your reaction told me. Even if I hadn't spoken out, you would have made the same point. Despite this, I seized your role as the camp's expert, using the single reason of being the victim of 'Gluttony'. Therefore..."</p>

            <p>He paused, deeply bowing his head. Then, with his lavender hair facing Otto,</p>

            <p>"I sincerely apologize. I'm sorry."</p>

            <p>Exposing him to his unquestionable regret, Otto bit the inside of his cheek hard. If his defensive reaction had been delayed, he might have bitten his lip in front of him. Even if Julius, with his head bowed, couldn't see, Anastasia certainly would have. That was absolutely something he needed to avoid.</p>

            <p>"Julius said he really wanted to apologize for that incident, huh? Well, if Otto-kun's hand hasn't healed yet, I thought it'd be easier to broach the topic," Anastasia confessed.</p>

            <p>"‚Ä¶ I see. I did something wrong, huh," Garfiel responded.</p>

            <p>"It's fine. Even without a trigger, our knight has always been able to properly apologize," she reassured.</p>

            <p>Ignoring Otto and Julius, the very ones concerned in this conversation, Anastasia and Garfiel exchanged remarks. All the while, Julius was bowed, awaiting his own turn to speak. Otto soon realized he was delaying his words.</p>

            <p>If Otto doesn't give some answer, this apology will never end.</p>

            <p>"...Please, raise your face," Otto finally let his words take flight.</p>

            <p>At his request, Julius also slowly lifted his bowed head. Seeing the knightly figure and the scar under his left eye that accentuated his stern countenance, Otto sighed. And then...</p>

            <p>"I do not doubt that there was no malice in your statement, and that you were trying to help Natsuki-san. But, you are an enemy. That remains unchanged."</p>

            <p>"Lord Otto..."</p>

            <p>"I am not a knight, so I don't have the opportunity to cross swords with you. You are not a merchant or a bureaucrat, so we won't cross words either. --Yet, even if it's neither a sword nor a word we will cross, you are my enemy, and I am yours."</p>

            <p>With a pained clench of his fist, Otto proclaimed to Julius.</p>

            <p>Upon receiving Otto's straightforward words, Julius widened his eyes. But his surprise was not from being considered an enemy by someone he did not think of as one, at least it salvaged Otto's pride in this situation.</p>

            <p>"Lady Anastasia, let me make something clear... regardless of what Natsuki-san or Emilia-san's intentions are, there are reasons in the empire to accommodate the Sin Archbishop. If the existence of the Sin Archbishop is used as grounds for slander, then the empire should bear the blame."</p>

            <p>"--. Mm, I have no objections to that. Even without that, our hands are already tied. We weren't planning on using this kind of thing to our advantage from the get-go. Go on, isn't that right?"</p>

            <p>Turning around, Otto proposes his armed theory, prompting Anastasia to narrow her eyes. She strokes her white fox fur collar as her gaze is drawn to another direction--undoubtedly towards the guest carriage where Subaru and the others might be.</p>

            <p>"No matter what sort of plan it is, the moment the Archbishop of Sin gets involved, regardless of how deep or shallow the connection is, it's only natural for others to show distaste. This isn't just about the Empire, nor is it only about people like Emilia, it's something that we can't reveal publicly."</p>

            <p>"If you understand that, then it's fine," said Anastasia in response. At her words, something in Otto relaxed slightly. When an Archbishop of Sin intervenes in a matter, no one would ever accept it positively, regardless of the situation. That was an immutable truth of this world.</p>

            <p>No matter what Julius, the victim, says, no matter what path the kind-hearted Emilia shows for forgiveness, no matter what foolish and high hopes Subaru has, that was how it had to be.</p>

            <p>Therefore, they had to confront each other. They each had their knives at each other's throats, holding onto the other's fatal vulnerabilities.</p>

            <p>"Excuse me, there's something I have to do. I'll excuse myself here," Otto abruptly excused himself having confirmed their shared understanding.</p>

            <p>"Huh?" Anastasia tilted her head at his sudden declaration. Beside her, Julius was digesting Otto's previous words, clearly shocked, but seeing his surprise was too painful for Otto who quickly turned his back.</p>

            <p>"Big bro! I too..."</p>

            <p>"Garfiel."</p>

            <p>"What?"</p>

            <p>"I'll be fine on my own."</p>

            <p>Otto, who tried to hurry out of the room, stopped Garfiel in his tracks with a gesture. His words felt more like a plea, not for the reassurance he was fine alone, but for him to be left alone. The considerate younger brother listened intently and sent a nod in his direction.</p>

            <p>Without another word, Otto closed the door of the room silently and left. He had left Garfiel in the same room as Anastasia and Julius. He was worried about what they might say in his absence, but he did not have the mental leeway to think about defending them.</p>

            <p>He didn't run, but his heart wasn't at peace, as if he wanted to burst into a run.</p>

            <p>"I...stole my role?"</p>

            <p>The words of Julius, who had bowed his head in apology, echoed in his mind, causing Otto to grit his teeth. The fact that Julius could apologize, it's just like Anastasia's knight being sincere and earnest. But Otto couldn't allow himself any such serene thoughts.</p>

            <p>Simply put, he had some bitter feelings about Julius‚Äô misunderstanding.</p>

            <p>Julius is deeply mistaken.</p>

            <p>If Julius hadn't spoken up in that place, Otto would never have said anything that would break Subaru's deadlock. While it's true that he can't lie that he didn't have the same thoughts as Julius, what he can affirm is that he absolutely wouldn't have vocalized those thoughts, not even at the brink of death.</p>

            <p>It wasn‚Äôt a sense of rage from having his role usurped.</p>

            <p>What shouldn't be said - no, what he didn't want to be said was stated, that‚Äôs why Otto was so furious at Julius in that place. Julius didn‚Äôt understand that.</p>

            <p>And yet he misunderstands that fact...</p>

            <p>"It's only natural, they are birds of a feather."</p>

            <p>Essentially, that‚Äôs proof that Julius is an idealist, just like Subaru, at the deepest level.</p>

            <p>He believes the essence of humanity is fundamentally kindhearted. But that doesn't mean it's easy. It isn't because he doesn't know reality. He knows reality and still, he can boast so.</p>

            <p>This is exactly the same way of LIGHT that Natsuki Subaru and Emilia walk.</p>

            <p>"..."</p>

            <p>"Otto-kun, that isn't good..."</p>

            <p>Suddenly, he felt his arm being grabbed, pulling him back to reality.</p>

            <p>Looking at what was happening, he realized he had unknowingly raised his arm and it was held back by someone from behind.</p>

            <p>Perhaps he was about to emotionally throw his arm against the wall. Otto‚Äôs right arm that had just been healed by Garfiel.</p>

            <p>"This mended arm was thanks to Garfiel‚Äôs healing magic wasn‚Äôt it? Even you would feel bad to break it again so soon after it healed, wouldn't you?"</p>

            <p>"...I admit I almost did something stupid, so could you let me go now?"</p>

            <p>A low voice unconsciously slips out, which surprises even Otto a little. However, seemingly used to it, the other person doesn't mention it and they finally let go of Otto‚Äôs hand.</p>

            <p>Standing there was Roswaal, whom Otto always rather not encounter. Although he usually doesn't want to meet him, this time he particularly didn't.</p>

            <p>"From that look on your face, you don't want to talk to me, do you?"</p>

            <p>"Well, for you to approach me despite seeing that, shows you're a die-hard, Lord Roswaal."</p>

            <p>"That's not like you, your sarcastic remark lacks its usual sharpness. You're taking this harder than I thought, aren't you?"</p>

            <p>".........."</p>

            <p>Of course, Roswaal had also participated in the discussion in the guest room earlier. He knew that Otto had been filled with anger in that situation, and that he held a firm opinion on how to deal with the Sin Archbishop. Knowing this and maintaining his attitude meant that his aim was crystal clear ‚Äì to provoke Otto. Otherwise, he was simply terrible at interacting with others.</p>

            <p>"Perhaps, Lord Margrave, you are aware, but I currently do not have the luxury of patience. If you don't want to be gnawed at by the rats I've bought and paid for, I suggest you not rub me the wrong way."</p>

            <p>"So it's clear, if I end up being gnawed on by rats in the future, you will be the culprit. Nevertheless, this is useful information ‚Ä¶ It shows you are worried about me."</p>

            <p>"‚Ä¶ Worried for me?"</p>

            <p>As he questioned, with a puzzled tone, Roswaal nodded. From this response, Otto understood that he was being taunted from a new angle. In this state of being out of patience, this type of antagonism truly makes him sick, adding to his dislike.</p>

            <p>"What do you think about this, Lord Margrave?"</p>

            <p>"Myself, huh? Well, just like Otto-kun, I think the Empire can go to ruins for all we care."</p>

            <p>"‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>

            <p>"Oh, was I wrong? The Sin Archbishop is nothing but a poison that can‚Äôt be utilized as a medicine. Instead of thinking of ways to make use of it, we‚Äôd be better off if the Empire disappeared. Just as you suggested to Subaru-kun, we simply need to abandon it and take back only the members who will feel guilty."</p>

            <p>Roswaal shrugged as if to say it was a brilliant plan, and Otto got a sick feeling from having his own opinions thrown back in his face. For Roswaal to propose to side with him and then purposely reject his method, his bad character was truly pushed to the limit. At the same time, even though he knew it was a realistic plan, he was fed up with himself for considering it the best one.</p>

            <p>Reading Otto's somewhat self-deprecating expression, Roswaal peered at him and said,</p>

            <p>"I just want to make this clear. I believe you are doing more than enough, Otto-kun."</p>

            <p>"‚Ä¶ It seems that without your makeup, your sharp tongue too loses its edge, Lord Margrave. It sounds as if you genuinely care for me."</p>

            <p>"I don't have the talent to empathize, so I wouldn‚Äôt attempt it anyway. Regardless, I believe that you're doing more than enough. However, we can discuss how much you're struggling."</p>

            <p>"‚Ä¶ What kind of struggle?"</p>

            <p>The oddly phrased words seemed to disturb Otto, causing a slight twitch of his eyebrows. In response to Otto's pondering, Roswaal gave a deep nod. He propped his thin chin upon his hand, closing his eyes, leaving only the blue ones visible on his unadorned face, and stated,</p>

            <p>"This recent event would serve as a good example. Most often, what Subaru-kun and Emilia-sama desired becomes reality. Everyone scrambles to pave the way for that to happen."</p>

            <p>"...What are you talking about?"</p>

            <p>Quite abruptly, Roswaal had started to say such things that Otto could not help narrowing his eyebrows. The notion that the wishes of Subaru and Emilia were always granted seemed utterly preposterous. If that were true, Emilia would have already become the queen, and she would be known as Natsuki Emilia.</p>

            <p>The fact that this was not the case meant that Roswaal's statement was false.</p>

            <p>"Are you making a fool out of me? Or maybe you're insulting Natsuki-san and Emilia-sama?"</p>

            <p>"Neither. I simply pity you. Your birth house also contributed to our journey from Lugunica to Volachia. For that, I want to thank you. Precisely why I decided to offer you this advice."</p>

            <p>"------"</p>

            <p>"Getting overly deeply involved, having differing opinions with Subaru-kun and Emilia-sama - that's toxic for you. I worry that this toxicity will gradually erode you and ultimately lead to your demise. After all, you are a person of invaluable talent."</p>

            <p>Quietly calming down his tone of voice, Roswaal directly expressed his concerns to Otto. Gradually, the light-hearted, clown-like demeanor was stripped away from his tone, replaced with sincerity as he looked straight at Otto Suwen.</p>

            <p>Finally, after a long silence, Otto began to comprehend - comprehend the motives of the man named Roswaal L. Mathers.</p>

            <p>"Lord of the Domain, I understand your point. But I cannot heed your advice."</p>

            <p>"Hmm....."</p>

            <p>Roswaal squinted his eyes, exhaling as if burdened with worries. Seeking the true intention behind Otto's refusal to accept his advice, Otto responded:</p>

            <p>"I get it - I'm the one who's in your way. I haven't forgiven you for what you've orchestrated, and I still suspect there's something you're scheming.‚Äù</p>

            <p>‚ÄúOh?‚Äù</p>

            <p>‚ÄúTherefore, you've seen my accumulated dissatisfaction and taken your chances to reach out to me. Perhaps you thought you could get rid of me by fabricating a reasonable excuse, but that's a big mistake.‚Äù</p>

            <p>Indeed, Roswaal's assumption was correct. The exchange from earlier could be considered the moment when Otto felt the most anger since he had joined Emilia's camp. Before he joined the camp, there were incidents where he was so angry he would punch Subaru out of the way, but his anger now was just as great as those times.</p>

            <p>"But it's a big mistake to think that I'll abandon everything because of this."</p>

            <p>"Otto-kun..."</p>

            <p>"What was all that nonsense from earlier? Do you think whatever Subaru and Lady Emilia wish for will just happen? Don't be ridiculous. Myself, Garfiel, Beatrice, Ram, Petra, Frederica, even Patrasche, we've all desperately fought our way to this point."</p>

            <p>Otto was honestly furious with Roswaal for his absurd assumption.</p>

            <p>This was Roswaal's reasoning - since Subaru and Emilia's wishes are always somehow fulfilled by those around them, there's no need for him to waste his energy needlessly worrying or opposing them. Roswaal said that no matter how much he opposes their views, he will be silenced, and his existence will become meaningless.</p>

            <p>But -</p>

            <p>"That's the complete opposite."</p>

            <p>"......"</p>

            <p>"I don't know how much you, Duke, are implying by saying that everyone's bending over backward... But at the very least, even if I were to side with every single opinion of Subaru, affirming all of them, and make every effort to get them all accepted... I don't think highly enough of myself to think that I could do this."</p>

            <p>He couldn't lend strong power like Beatrice and Garfiel.</p>

            <p>He couldn't offer indispensable support like Ram, Frederica, and Petra.</p>

            <p>As someone who couldn't exercise the power to fulfill everything they wished for, what was the meaning of Otto's existence?</p>

            <p>"I can't do that. I can't approve of it. I can't allow it. When Subaru and Lady Emilia wish for something, the moment they stop voicing their wish, that's the moment my reason for existence disappears."</p>

            <p>"......"</p>

            <p>"Regrettably, Duke, things won't go as you wish."</p>

            <p>Clearly and with determination, that's how Otto declared to Roswaal, fixing his gaze upon him. He had never before confronted Roswaal so head-on all at once.</p>

            <p>Of course, though they never voiced it, a prickling tension always hung between Otto and Roswaal. As such, whenever Roswaal saw an opportunity, he would press Otto to remove obstacles, seeking to manipulate the situation to his advantage.</p>

            <p>However, Otto refused to bow, at least not to whimsical reasoning like today's.</p>

            <p>"I have found my place. I may not walk the path of light, but that's all right."</p>

            <p>"........"</p>

            <p>"That was a bad move, Margrave. You should not have approached me."</p>

            <p>He wished to express his unchanging conviction.</p>

            <p>Nonetheless, he should have taken more time to reach his conclusion, to waver a bit more. Instead, Roswaal hastened his desired outcome, which unexpectedly led to an undesirable one.</p>

            <p>Otto took a deep breath in front of Roswaal, who was making a bitter, meaningful face.</p>

            <p>"Ah, there you are, Mr. Otto!"</p>

            <p>Light footsteps patter about, and high-pitched voice called out for Otto. Turning around, he met the gaze of Petra, who was waving and running towards him.</p>

            <p>"Young Lady Petra... er, I mean, Petra-chan."</p>

            <p>Almost slipping out the more formal address, Otto swiftly corrected himself, lightly placing a hand over his mouth. Petra, who had dashed up to him, was slightly out of breath.</p>

            <p>"Mr. Otto, is your hand okay? I heard you hit the wall really hard..."</p>

            <p>"That's what everyone's been asking. Fortunately, Garfiel healed it for me, so it's fine now. Sorry to have worried you."</p>

            <p>"It's okay as long as you're fine... What's the master doing?"</p>

            <p>Otto chuckled wistfully, showing Petra his healed hand to assure her. Relieved, Petra quickly turned her stern gaze to Roswaal.</p>

            <p>Roswaal met her piercing gaze with a frail shake of his head, replying, "I was ruminating on my usual conduct."</p>

            <p>"The master...? Reflect? You never do that, so it wouldn't taste like anything, would it?"</p>

            <p>"Yikes."</p>

            <p>Otto intended to give Roswaal a stern talk, but the intensity of Petra's words blew his efforts out of the water.</p>

            <p>In fact, Roswaal also had his shoulders dropped, but just as Petra was watching him intently, she suddenly let out an "Ah!" as if remembering something important.</p>

            <p>Then she turned to Otto, waving the ribbon on top of her head,</p>

            <p>"Speaking of which, not just hands, I heard something. A little while ago, you were discussing about Louis-chan, so..."</p>

            <p>"Ah, yes, that's right. If so, then I am sorry for the worry I caused..."</p>

            <p>"That's why I've slapped Subaru on your behalf."</p>

            <p>"‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"</p>

            <p>Tightening her small hand into a fist, Petra flatly stated so.</p>

            <p>On seeing her thrusted fist and her determined face, Otto blinked in surprise.</p>

            <p>At such a reaction from Otto, Petra huffed a little and said,</p>

            <p>"Otto-san, I heard that you were putting up with it. Because if you were to hit the tiny current Subaru, it would be pitiful. That's why, I did it."</p>

            <p>Opening her clenched fist, Petra showed her palm. In front of it, Otto stayed silent for a moment.</p>

            <p>But it was impossible.</p>

            <p>"Ha, ha ha ha, ah ha ha ha!"</p>

            <p>He was able to bear with the discomfort when Julius apologized to him.</p>

            <p>He was also able to bear the helplessness when he was being aggressively attacked by Roswaal.</p>

            <p>But he couldn't bear the pleasant words from Petra now.</p>

            <p>Laughing doesn't solve anything.</p>

            <p>The problem remained, and Otto, as usual, stood against Subaru's thoughts.</p>

            <p>Yet, as a being who keeps opposing, against the solution Subaru found, he continues to insist that it's wrong, because it's the reason for his existence.</p>

            <p>Humbling himself is out of the question.</p>

            <p>"Petra-chan"</p>

            <p>"Yes?"</p>

            <p>"Thank you."</p>

            <p>Saying so, Otto placed his palm against the palm the girl had extended.</p>

            <p>A light clapping sound was heard, and Petra smiled, "You're welcome".</p>
