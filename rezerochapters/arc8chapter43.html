            <p>Aldebaran knew what a "Stargazer" was.</p>

            <p>The one who had once imparted this knowledge to him was an entity that seemed to have exhausted the knowledge of every conceivable matter in the world and yet greedily coveted the unknown.</p>

            <p>Their relationship was complex.</p>

            <p>It was not someone he could simply describe with words of liking or disliking.</p>

            <p>If one were to ask whether he was grateful, he probably was, to some extent. But there was resentment, too—a dissatisfaction as strong as his gratitude. That was the kind of entity it was.</p>

            <p>In any case, no matter who had taught him, Aldebaran was well aware of the circumstances surrounding the "Stargazers."</p>

            <p>However, this knowledge did nothing to contribute to the success or failure of his ardent wish. It was more crucial that he had involved 'It' than any interest or involvement of the "Stargazers."</p>

            <p>At first, when Priscilla declared her intention to head for Vollachia, he tried various ways to dissuade her, but once she made up her mind, there was no bending her will.</p>

            <p>So, he accompanied her, endeavoring to be as much insurance as possible—but encountering 'It' in this empire was a cruel twist of fate for Aldebaran.</p>

            <p>Always, fate intervened in Aldebaran's life in the most unpleasant ways.</p>

            <p>He had never had any fondness for fate, but this time he felt gratitude.</p>

            <p>If 'It' was involved, that changed everything. If he could entangle 'It,' the situation would shift dramatically.</p>

            <p>If 'It' could be included in the inescapable framework, and if that framework could be expanded further and further, beyond what one could hold in their hands, then Aldebaran's desperate wish would be realized.</p>

            <p>Once, Aldebaran had abandoned everything.</p>

            <p>He had trekked through darkness, relying only on the meager light of stars, and given up, convinced it was all in vain.</p>

            <p>That’s why the sun was so dazzling. As if there was no such thing as darkness, his resignation was incinerated.</p>

            <p>If it was to protect that bright sun, he wouldn't mind groveling to fate. He wouldn't hesitate to endure excruciating pain, to squarely face 'It.'</p>

            <p>"Witch," "Stargazer," "Great Disaster," it didn't matter what stood in his way.</p>

            <p>—Just please, don't interfere with me.</p>

            <p>---</p>

            <p>Twenty-two trials.</p>

            <p>That was the number of attempts it took for Al to grasp what had happened to him. In a split second, his body had evaporated without him even realizing; such was the suddenness of the whiteout.</p>

            <p>"—Nah, it's not snow or clouds causing this but fire, so it should be a redout. Crimson out works too, sounds cooler," he muttered cynically as he exhaled deeply.</p>

            <p>Whether his mind was sound, he couldn't say, but at the very least, he convinced himself of his sanity on the flimsiest of grounds.</p>

            <p>That would have to suffice for now. The problem was—</p>

            <p>"In a fight of this level, there's no room for me to intervene!"</p>

            <p>As Al shouted this, one of the tasks that had to be accomplished in the imperial capital—a single point in the star-shaped fortifications, one of the five peaks, was taken down.</p>

            <p>The defense once boasted by the robust walls had vanished without a trace, marking a clear achievement of their objective.</p>

            <p>However, at the second peak, where the high walls and surrounding buildings had been wiped clean away, a greater obstacle stood as the next challenge.</p>

            <p>---</p>

            <p>A girl who stained the cloudy skies red, floating in the air through some unfathomable principle—her short silver hair, red eyes, and exposed dark skin made for a stunningly beautiful sight, one that would ordinarily captivate the onlooker, but now it only rattled their primal sense of danger.</p>

            <p>Entrusting the master of thorns to Groovy, utilizing the garments of the werewolf, Al and Cecilus had managed to safely reach—or rather, were about to reach—the second peak.</p>

            <p>Strictly speaking, the second peak had been obliterated, and Al had suffered countless incomprehensible damages in the process. Only after enduring these trials had he figured out a way to proceed.</p>

            <p>The thought of enduring the same ordeal again and contemplating how many overtime battles it might require was too dreadful to consider.</p>

            <p>So—</p>

            <p>"—Thought experiment reboot, territory redefinition."</p>

            <p>Updating his mental matrix every few seconds, or perhaps even seconds, Al desperately searched for an opportunity to escape.</p>

            <p>As he had just screamed, there was no room for him to intervene. Yet, every time Al suffered a fatal blow, the world would reset to a predetermined point and make no progress.</p>

            <p>If Cecilus would pick him up, like that sniper incident, and pull him out of the critical zone to escape together, it would be a different story, but—</p>

            <p>"I'm sorry, Mr. Al. However, my intuition is screaming at me. This is my moment to shine, and if I attend to you, I'll undermine my own reason to live,"</p>

            <p>And with that, Cecilus promptly abandoned his duty to protect Al and challenged the girl in the sky—Arakiya.</p>

            <p>This was not the first time Al had encountered her. Looking back, they had fought side by side when she was still young during their gladiator days on the Gladiator Island, and later became adversaries in the fortress city of Guaral. Now, in the imperial capital, their relationship had only deteriorated as she vanished him away.</p>

            <p>Yet, beyond being a recurring acquaintance, it was evident, just as Cecilus said, that Arakiya was far from her normal state.</p>

            <p>"——"</p>

            <p>Arakiya, writhing midair, clearly was not in her usual condition. Al had heard bits about the "Spirit Eater" from Priscilla. He had witnessed with his own eyes her transforming into fire or water, but this was unmistakably different.</p>

            <p>Unlike when she assimilated her body with water or flew as part of a flame, Arakiya's current state seemed on the brink of being torn apart from within by a colossal, white light.</p>

            <p>Her slender, dark body was from within punctuated or seemingly grown over with thin, yellow-tinged transparent crystals.</p>

            <p>Purified magic stones are referred to as magic crystals, and they completely enveloped Arakiya's body.</p>

            <p>If she had appeared calm, one might have thought it was just a display of her powers as a "Spirit Eater"—but—</p>

            <p>"——!"</p>

            <p>From her clouded red eyes, tears flowed from the left one, and her lips parted in a pained plea for help.</p>

            <p>No one could regard this as normal or a state Arakiya herself desired.</p>

            <p>Just like how one would understand the cries of a bawling child who repeatedly hits you, dripping with abundant tears, even with your eyes, ears, and skin shut—</p>

            <p>What Arakiya was doing was exactly that.</p>

            <p>"You're not saying I can ignore a crying child, are you?!"</p>

            <p>Clutching his head and frantically trying to escape destruction, Al shouted desperately at Cecilus' back as he charged headlong into the fray.</p>

            <p>Hearing this, Cecilus did not look back but shook his shoulders as if laughing, indicating he found amusement in Al's outcry.</p>

            <p>"The tears of children and women can trigger the unfolding of a story. It's only natural for me to not overlook such things, but this time, it's different," he said.</p>

            <p>"Then what—?" she exclaimed.</p>

            <p>"But—I have use for those tears."</p>

            <p>As soon as he had spoken, Cecilus leaped with the speed of lightning, using a part of the dissolved rubble as a foothold.</p>

            <p>Around him, the barricade constructed to protect the second pinnacle had melted away, manifesting like a vision of hell filled with flowing magma. One careless step into the magma meant not just a slip, but instant carbonization of the affected part, a damage beyond recognition. He knew this from experience.</p>

            <p>Yet, Cecilus plunged into this garden of molten magma, utilizing the limited footholds to head toward Arakiya, who floated in the air.</p>

            <p>His speed and audacity were indescribable—no, truly indescribable was the act gestated immediately after, as a casual humming tune.</p>

            <p>"No way!?" she gasped.</p>

            <p>In the air, Arakiya's body shone white, and in an instant, a flash of light scorched the very spot where Cecilus was running.</p>

            <p>The light lance launched into the magma, and after a beat, compressed space around it a few meters in diameter, immediately exploding with force. The compressed magma and its destructive power spread far and wide, many times the area of the affected space.</p>

            <p>Al was speechless, instinctively protecting his head with his arm from the distance he knew he could not reach, and yet the onslaught did not stop. One shot, then two, three, four—the very visage of the imperial capital was being reshaped.</p>

            <p>Streets no longer were streets, land no longer was land.</p>

            <p>And as the earth-shattering bursts followed Cecilus, one after another, even he—</p>

            <p>"Tatatatatatatatatatatata—!"</p>

            <p>Cecilus bolted furiously through the space showered with death, dodging the deadly glimpses of flashing light, the sizzling magma spit, and the white dust, sprinting through the chaos on what might have been Zori sandals with seemingly no fire resistance at all.</p>

            <p>To Al, it seemed as ludicrous as the ninjas' absurdity in running atop water—before one foot sinks, the other steps forward. And Cecilus was doing just that, but on magma instead of water.</p>

            <p>"That's impossible!?"</p>

            <p>"Those who think so will never understand—forever!"</p>

            <p>In response to Al's shout, Cecilus's clear and cheerful reply came as he continued to defy the laws of physics with sheer determination, crashing into a spared house. The next moment, a column kicked from the collapsing building shot through the air like an arrow.</p>

            <p>The massive projectile, too large to be simply called an arrow, flew toward Arakiya at a speed that could pierce the torso of a colossal beast. But it ignited before hitting the target, burning to nothing midair.</p>

            <p>Around the glowing Arakiya, the atmosphere itself distorted with the heat radiating from her, making it impossible for any physical attack to draw near.</p>

            <p>Cecilus must have understood this. Yet—</p>

            <p>"Tei! Teitei! Teiteiteitei!"</p>

            <p>With thunderous noise, Cecilus continued to demolish houses, their columns, roofs, and possessions kicked with imperceptible speed through the air, assaulting Arakiya aloft.</p>

            <p>Of course, none could reach; all vanished before her. And the retribution for these unreachable attacks was deadly light arrows, grazing by would be fatal.</p>

            <p>"You fool, stop, can't you see!? Blindly drawing attention will—"</p>

            <p>"What are you saying, Al sir! It's the opposite, the complete opposite! I need to draw her complete attention to me!"</p>

            <p>"This show-off... no."</p>

            <p>Continually contributing to the destruction of buildings and subsequently the landscape of the imperial capital, Cecilus's usual statement of being the star actor was too serious to be laughed at now. Realizing this, Al noticed Cecilus's positioning, always keeping Arakiya inside the imperial capital while he moved to the outer edge to draw her attacks—thus fighting without directing her destructive powers inward.</p>

            <p>Finally understanding what Cecilus meant, Al spoke.</p>

            <p>"Right now that woman has neither consciousness nor reason. What she has is merely the instinctual defensive behavior to not explode or be killed. If we leave her alone, she will wander toward the center of the city. But what if she rampages there?"</p>

            <p>"An unlivable hole will open for the next hundred years..."</p>

            <p>"And a lot of people will die. Enemies, perhaps, but it wouldn't be ideal if many non-hostile humans perished. The world would become a lonelier place."</p>

            <p>With a calm voice, Cecilus evaded the deadly light aiming to graze him and surrendered himself to the lightning speed required to carry out his intentions.</p>

            <p>Unexpectedly hit with the true intention of a sensible Cecilus, Al hooked his fingers on the hot iron of his helmet, adjusting its angle, and steeled himself.</p>

            <p>Indeed, as Cecilus said, Arakiya currently lacked the capacity to extend her consciousness outward.</p>

            <p>Having absorbed something beyond Al's imagination, Arakiya was desperately trying to contain it, reflexively countering any perceived threats.</p>

            <p>And Cecilus, knowing this was necessary to prevent the destruction of the imperial capital, purposely placed himself within the dangerous distance to keep provoking her, holding her in place here.</p>

            <p>Silently reflecting on Cecilus's aim and the strange situation of Arakiya, Al knew the option to turn his back and run was always flickering in his mind. Even Cecilus could lose a leg.</p>

            <p>But his presence would make a difference—if it meant he had worth being there.</p>

            <p>"Let's do this."</p>

            <p>Loosening his neck with a shake, Al took a deep breath. He didn't know how much more misfortune he would draw after already being dealt a bad hand twenty-two times in a row, nor what would happen to his sanity in the end. However, whether sane or not, he was certain of one thing—the sun remained dazzling.</p>

            <p>"Then, I'm fine with that."</p>

            <p>With a flick on the metal of his helmet, creating a sound, Al took a step forward.</p>

            <p>And then—</p>

            <p>The white light aimed at Cecilus exploded several meters away, and as the resulting magma projectiles, impossible to dodge, came straight at him—</p>

            <p>"It's time for the next."</p>

            <p>—He committed himself to the grand stage befit of an ordinary person in this redefined domain.</p>

            <p>At the crux of the heaving gales and swirling dust, with the swift sweep of an elongated leg, the figure of Rowan Segmunt, who had spent his life honing the godly art of Void, was sent spiraling through the air—a dazzling skillset perhaps, but barely more than a flashy trick to the transcendental monstrosities he faced.</p>

            <p>Such was the spectacle as he swiftly ducked a heavy kick, seeking to slit the slender waist of his foe with his blade. The ensuing shock to his chest, however, came not from a foot but from several tails sprouting from the woman's hips—tails of a fox adorned with soft beast fur—delivering an unbelievably powerful blow that sent him hurtling backwards, bouncing off the ground.</p>

            <p>His vision oscillated once, twice, flipping over as he bid farewell to the sky on the third, and with a forceful stab of his sword into the earth, he halted his momentum. Grinding his heel into the ground and clenching his back teeth, he sheathed his sword with swift precision, readying himself for the draw-and-cut stance.</p>

            <p>"Have you, perchance, comprehended it now?" Iris asked.</p>

            <p>"---?!" Rowan gasped in surprise.</p>

            <p>The initial movement of his sword technique, meant to flash with the drawing of the blade, was halted by the woman's hand now clasping the hilt of the sword within its sheath. In that fraction of a moment, as he was struck speechless, Iris's long eyes sorrowfully lowered.</p>

            <p>"Against me, Master, you can surely not prevail."</p>

            <p>With reigning mercy instead of severing wrath, Rowan did not attempt to yank out the contained sword; rather he held firm the hilt's position, withdrawing the sheath, and with a half-turn, he struck the face of his opponent with the scabbard, crafted from the bone of demonic beasts.</p>

            <p>The vigor, the angle, the satisfaction in the follow-through, all would have been ample to shatter a human skull.</p>

            <p>But---</p>

            <p>"------"</p>

            <p>The only thing to crumble under the impact was the sheath itself, while the woman—named Iris—showed not the slightest hint of discomfort across her features. Merely quivering her lips that still bore pity, she lifted the hand that had been holding back the handle and warned,</p>

            <p>"I won't let you die, but it'll hurt enough to wish you had."</p>

            <p>The palm-strike to his forehead sent Rowan careening backwards, and this time, without any resistance or preparedness, he flew, tumbling end over end down the long boulevard in front of the Crystal Palace, bouncing dozens of meters without hindrance.</p>

            <p>Bounding, rolling, tumbling, until finally sprawling out in a sprawl.</p>

            <p>With only a brief clash, Rowan Segmunt was brought to the brink of death, his eyes wide open in astonishment.</p>

            <p>So strong, impossibly strong was she—a strength beyond belief. He had been well aware that his foe was formidable. Still, he possessed the conviction that in the end, victory would be his.</p>

            <p>Such had always been the case, or so he had presumed—until now.</p>

            <p>Let us discuss here a piece of Rowan Segmunt's misfortune.</p>

            <p>Heinkel Astrea, who accompanied Rowan, was a man who had never been chosen for any blessing that was not granted except to the chosen. On the other hand, Rowan Segmunt had always been chosen, and it was precisely this that had brought him misfortune.</p>

            <p>Rowan had a yearning, something he'd pursued tirelessly—a prayer he'd continued to crave with ardent hunger. To reach the "Heavenly Sword," he'd endured all hardships, completed all necessary tasks, and despite being cursed as a devil or monster, he was determined to fulfill his hunger.</p>

            <p>His desire was without the slightest falsehood or deceit, untouched by compromise or resignation.</p>

            <p>He was never insincere in the pursuit of perfecting his swordsmanship and techniques, nor did he ever neglect his training, not even once.</p>

            <p>But Rowan Segmunt failed to encounter.</p>

            <p>To find rivals who would elevate his own strength, formidable enemies who would push him to surpass himself, someone to love who would take him to realms unreachable alone—he met none.</p>

            <p>Every opponent he faced fell to his blade, and by some twist of fate, he never clashed with the myriad of transcendent entities that existed, always just missing the chance to do so until he became so desperate he wished for death, only then to be chosen as a "Stargazer."</p>

            <p>Had the opportunities arisen, Rowan Segmunt might have become renowned for his swordsmanship.</p>

            <p>But Rowan had no rivals, no formidable enemies, no loved ones, nothing but solitude.</p>

            <p>He hadn't resolved himself to the idea that emotions were unnecessary in the pursuit of the sword, nor had he suffered the bitter betrayal from those he had bonds with.</p>

            <p>Rowan simply had never encountered anyone who could show him where he stood or push him beyond his current limits.</p>

            <p>He had avoided the initial attack of Iris, who stood beneath the Crystal Palace, simply because she was an adversary without the intent to kill.</p>

            <p>The reason why the undead Balleroy Temeglyph had fled from the "Cloud Cleaver" was because he feared the unexpected counterstrike from Cecilus Segmunt, avoiding further pursuit.</p>

            <p>Rowan had remained unscathed amidst the "Great Disaster" caused by the undead army because he had only ever faced foes his swordsmanship affected.</p>

            <p>Even when he was driven by a whim to suggest the assassination of the emperor and refused by Cecilus Segmunt, it was only because he whimsically imagined it'd be exciting if his father truly grew stronger, returned, and crossed swords with him.</p>

            <p>To this very day, Rowan Segmunt had managed to cling to life because at every critical juncture, he had somehow always tipped the scales in favor of fortune.</p>

            <p>And now, here in the imperial city turned necropolis, the enemy Rowan encountered was also the only one who had no intention of taking his life.</p>

            <p>---The world would not grant Rowan his wishes, yet it always illuminated a path for his survival.</p>

            <p>"------"</p>

            <p>"Will you continue, might I inquire?"</p>

            <p>Slowly, as Rowan raised himself from the ground sprawled out in a splayed form, Iris frowned at him. Though a considerable distance had formed between them, the tangible presence exuded by her seemed to make her words audibly clear to him.</p>

            <p>---No, perhaps this was a change brought on by encountering a powerful enemy for the first time.</p>

            <p>As if a solid, indestructible shell that had always been surrounding him had been shattered, such sensations may have been the cause. Through this, he came to a sharp realization.</p>

            <p>Directly before him, gazing steadily in his direction, was the overwhelming mana circulating through the entire being of Iris---its vastness, along with the clear understanding from their recent clash.</p>

            <p>In the devastated Lupgana, Iris stood as the guardian of the Crystal Palace, where presumably the mastermind of the enemy lurked---this woman indeed was the most formidable existence of the Vollachian Empire. Superior even to Cecilus, hailed as "The First" amongst the "Nine Divine Generals," she was the ultimate being born for this Disaster.</p>

            <p>"Ha ha ha, what serendipity, what a glorious day this is...!"</p>

            <p>Feeling the reality skin-deep, Rowan grinned, his teeth bared, as if his son was singing at the top of his voice inside his head. To reach the "Heavenly Sword," he had thought the only way was to cut down his son, who had achieved it. However, if he had now encountered a being even surpassing Cecilus, the story would progress rapidly.</p>

            <p>Not a second too late, but now. Now, in this very moment, Rowan Segmunt was to reach the pinnacle of swordsmanship, taking his seat as the "Heavenly Sword."</p>

            <p>For that purpose—</p>

            <p>"—Swordsman, Rowan Segmunt."</p>

            <p>Once again, he slid his barely retained sword back into its sheath, spreading his feet and taking his stance ready to draw it at any time. Iris, standing far in his sight, their distance widened, which was the end of his luck—or rather, the bounty of his days bathed in sweat and blood striving for the peak.</p>

            <p>All that remained was to collect the equivalent price from the slender neck of Iris.</p>

            <p>"—'Cloud Cleaver'."</p>

            <p>With the sheath running, the sword gleam was released, heading straight for Iris who stood frozen. The flash that sliced through the air in its path, shredding intervening leaves, leaving behind sound and wind, was the most finely honed strike of Rowan's life.</p>

            <p>That was to behead the woman in the beautiful dress, Iris—</p>

            <p>"—It ends here."</p>

            <p>Tilting her head, effortlessly dodging Rowan's greatest strike like a breath, Iris spoke with a strong push off the ground to advance forward.</p>

            <p>Rowan was not given time by the final existence of "Disaster" to unleash a second blow.</p>

            <p>△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>The impact that struck from above buried Rowan helplessly deep into the street.</p>

            <p>"—"</p>

            <p>Overlooking the figure of the swordsman buried face-first into the ground, Iris flipped the hem of her dress, turning her back to the man she had just faced. He was no longer a threat with his back turned, likely devoid of any fighting strength.</p>

            <p>Sadly, even if he had strength left and attempted a surprise attack, it would not reach Iris.</p>

            <p>"Leave the capital while you still have your life."</p>

            <p>Words that would be spoken to the weak with a flick of a finger, or to a formidable opponent after a death match. As an opponent, Rowan was terribly troublesome—neither weak nor strong. If anything, he was at the pinnacle of the ordinary.</p>

            <p>And in the current capital, that reality could even be considered a sin.</p>

            <p>"A sin, is it? By what right does one even..."</p>

            <p>Gently pressing on her own chest, Iris muttered as if cursing herself. Yet, she had decided. Decided irrevocably. And executed it without making excuses. It didn't matter how many came at her, as long as she could repel them all.</p>

            <p>Thus, the story of Iris and Yggdrasil would—</p>

            <p>"—Why do you rise?"</p>

            <p>Without turning, Iris paused and questioned the presence behind her. It was the sign of Rowan, the swordsman she'd thought felled by her previous strike, standing up. She regretted not taking his consciousness, chiding herself for her softness—had she used more force, she might have crushed his skull. It was never her intention to take his life.</p>

            <p>Had her awareness of the significant gap in strength between them been too naive? Even with a power difference, there were times when one cannot back down—was this also the case?</p>

            <p>"If you are resolved to be relentless, then so too must one prepare to stand against all odds. However, I..."</p>

            <p>"That's not what I intend. And that, is the problem."</p>

            <p>A faltering, hoarse reply came, beyond Iris's comprehension.</p>

            <p>If this was the pride of a warrior or the stubbornness of a man, Iris could not fathom it.</p>

            <p>Iris thought. She prioritized what was dear to her over those feelings.</p>

            <p>"So, if you cannot give up just yet—"</p>

            <p>She would continue until his spirit broke, even if her own heart began to fracture.</p>

            <p>Just as Iris was about to confront Rowan's determination, at that moment—</p>

            <p>"...Eh?"</p>

            <p>Her turn revealed utter shock. It wasn't some aberration where Rowan had miraculously bridged the gap in power between them, nor someone intruding upon the scene to direct a weapon at Iris instead of Rowan.</p>

            <p>There was only Rowan; yet what shocked Iris was undoubtedly his doing—</p>

            <p>—With his sword, he had lethally slashed his own throat.</p>

            <p>"Why?"</p>

            <p>One beat later, blood gushed with tremendous force from the severed vessels of the neck. The city streets swiftly stained with spilled blood, as the lifeblood drained from Rowan Segmunt's body, absorbed by the earth.</p>

            <p>"Why would you...?"</p>

            <p>Gasping at the sight beyond comprehension, Iris let breath slip from her lips. Amidst that, Rowan, bleeding from the neck, opened his eyes wide, suffused with a maniacal light, and laughed while blood flowed from the corner of his mouth.</p>

            <p>Laughing, he said.</p>

            <p>"Even in death, I am—"</p>

            <p>His words cut off as Rowan's blue eyes rolled back, showing whites before he collapsed. Sensing death rather than mere unconsciousness, Iris instinctively ran over, reaching to save the life of the man who had, only moments before, tried to end hers.</p>

            <p>But her hand did not reach the deceased.</p>

            <p>Because—</p>

            <p>"—I will reach the 'Heavenly Sword'."</p>

            <p>Corpse-like creatures, once Rowan Segmunt and now freshly slain, attacked from all sides, assailing Iris as she dashed forward.</p>

            <p>△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>—When the breath of the dragon ripped through the imperial streets, Heinkel could do almost nothing.</p>

            <p>Only by flailing his sword at the beckoning of his survival instinct, digging a hole in the ground as merely a placebo, did he manage to slide into it just in time.</p>

            <p>After all, the dragon's breath gouged deeply even through the earth along its path, so perhaps the placebo was not even that.</p>

            <p>Thus, the life of Heinkel Astrea, the current head of the "Sword Saint" family that had defended the parent dragon kingdom for years, was ironically obliterated without a trace by the "Dragon's" breath—</p>

            <p>"—Hey hey, can't die so easily, old man."</p>

            <p>Grasped by the neck, Heinkel was forcibly pulled from the hole he had barely made. Lifted with fierce momentum, he then scented the charred stench of the world scorched by the dragon's breath.</p>

            <p>"Whoa, ooh, aah!?"</p>

            <p>As the world spun, blood from his cracked forehead mixed with the bile overflowing from his mouth. Disregarding the contents of his body, he experienced a sense of floating before landing harshly on the ground. Thrown down without managing a proper fall, he propped himself up on an arm, taking in his surroundings.</p>

            <p>"—"</p>

            <p>An involuntary groan escaped him upon witnessing the devastation at the place he had just fled. Touched by the dragon's breath, the area had completely disintegrated into white steam. Had his escape been any slower, he would have been part of that steam.</p>

            <p>"I thought my role was causing a ruckus in the south to draw people's attention... Ha! I couldn't believe my eyes."</p>

            <p>"Ah...?"</p>

            <p>"Fancy that, I thought you'd run for sure. But you've got some spine, don't you, old man?"</p>

            <p>Within the roughness, there was a voice imbued with certain admiration. Heinkel turned towards the source of the voice beside him and saw the figure who had drawn him out.</p>

            <p>Backlit and thus with an indistinct face, the person stood. The ringing in his ears from the recent impact of the dragon's tail swipe made it impossible to tell if he recognized the voice.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, the figure, as if dismissing such concerns, clicked their teeth and stepped forward.</p>

            <p>Kneeling on the ground, Heinkel was left behind as the figure confronted the immense "Cloud Dragon" that towered before them.</p>

            <p>Then, with vigor, they brought both fists together before their chest and declared,</p>

            <p>"――I, the great one, will lend you a hand, old man! They say, 'One cannot lift a Quain Stone alone,' don't they?!"</p>

            <p>――Like a beast roaring, the vanguard of the "Vollachian Empire Salvation Squad," Garfiel Tinsel, cried out as he initiated combat with the "Cloud Dragon."</p>

            <p>--------</p>

            <p>[Tappei's Comment]</p>

            <p>I apologize for having completely reversed the map of "The Imperial Capital Lupgana" in my head and describing it erroneously up to the previous chapter. Such an embarrassing mistake led to descriptions that were the opposite of those up to chapter seven. Therefore, I have corrected the five points of the "Capital" mentioned so far in this eighth chapter. I deeply apologize for any confusion caused.</p>
