        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>Natsuki Subaru thought they were in a truly strange relationship. More than strange, it was a malicious circumstance that had led Subaru and the others here.</p>

            <p>Subaru detested everything about it, the principles and existence - the Vollachia Empire. The dismay that can only be silently wept, Rem who had lost all her "Memories". The irritation that everything was her fault, the Archbishop of "Gluttony" Louis Arneb.</p>

            <p>He had been in a situation where cursing was the only option, crying and getting angry as per the laid-out tracks, surviving day by day dying over and over again.</p>

            <p>But there were also people in Vollachia Empire who he had connected with, who had helped. The kindness and concern that Rem, lacking "Memories", showed him, matched the tears. The many times he had put his life on the line, the Archbishop of "Gluttony," Louis Arneb, had served him bravely.</p>

            <p>Chewing up the curse that had been prepared for him, refusing to follow along the laid-out tracks, injuring each other gently, Subaru lived through these days, dying and dying over again.</p>

            <p>To curse, to grieve, to hate. Or, not to curse, not to grieve, to forgive. A time had come to settle the vague and ongoing relationship.</p>

            <p>"-----"</p>

            <p>As Subaru, who had come to the guest room, declared, a sense of tension filled the room. The room contained, Rem, Louis, and in addition to that, Ram and Tanza, a total of four people. The former, as the party involved, and the latter, as witnesses, Subaru wanted to talk to them.</p>

            <p>Emilia, Beatrice, and the others are waiting for a resolution. Natsuki Subaru's answer, no matter what form it takes.</p>

            <p>"...is your important talk with Abel over?"</p>

            <p>Rem, who was holding Louis's hand beside her, was the first to speak to Subaru, who had been thinking about how to start. Whether she was conscious or not, her actions seemed to be suppressing something.</p>

            <p>To that question, Subaru shook his head,</p>

            <p>"It's on hold for now. I can't move forward with that discussion until I've taken care of things here... The talk with Abel is also related to Louis."</p>

            <p>"Huh?"</p>

            <p>"Why is it related to Louis?"</p>

            <p>"The prophecy of the 'Astrologer' states that for this battle to be won, Louis's existence is crucial, that's why."</p>

            <p>"---!"Subaru's straightforward premise caused a grimace to cross Rem's face. Holding on to Louis's hand, Rem locked eyes with Subaru, her pale blue orbs piercing as she said,</p>

            <p>"Do you intend to make Louis fight? Such a tiny child who knows nothing.. You can't be so cruel..."</p>

            <p>"Whether he needs to fight or not, we'll put aside for now. But first, let me clarify one thing. Louis may seem clueless, but that's not true."</p>

            <p>"What do you mean..."</p>

            <p>"Even though he struggles with communicating verbally, Louis understands the situation he's in. He can choose who he wants to ally with and who he doesn't. Knowing this, he chose to stay here."</p>

            <p>"That is..."</p>

            <p>Subaru's calm words left Rem speechless, her gaze falling to the floor. Rem knew, deep down, that Subaru's retort was the truth. If Louis was truly clueless, he wouldn't be here in the first place.</p>

            <p>Louis has been unceasingly dependent since they first met him in the unfamiliar situation when they got sent to the Vollachian Empire - but that hardly explains everything, considering the insane measures they had to take to survive.</p>

            <p>If an imprint isn't a sign of affection but a manifestation of the defense instinct seeking a protector for survival, it is needless to say that being with Rem and Subaru doesn't serve Louis's survival. If his goal was to merely survive, life would have been easier for Louis without Subaru and the rest.</p>

            <p>On that note, Ram agreed with Subaru too. "I've only heard bits and pieces from Rem, but as far as I understand, the child chose to be here, away from Rem and Subaru. It was his choice."</p>

            <p>"Sister..."</p>

            <p>"Don't misunderstand, Rem. I am on your side, and I have every intention of tearing Subaru apart later, but that doesn't mean I will twist the truth."</p>

            <p>"There are some parts of your statement that I can't ignore, but... thanks."</p>

            <p>Interrupting, Subaru expressed his mixed feelings of gratitude and bitterness towards Ram. He felt her words were also a veiled warning. At the same time, it signaled that Ram intended to remain impartial in this discussion and would not play into her emotions to side with Rem.</p>

            <p>That was indeed the behaviour that Rem had been expressing repeatedly about Ram.</p>

            <p>"Maybe, my sister is just too kind..."A whisper, audible only in the speaker's mouth — it was uncertain if Ram heard it or not. Without saying anything, she just gave a small snort through her nose and took a sip from her tea cup, crossing her slender legs.</p>

            <p>Beside her, Tanzo, who looked somewhat distant, shifted his black eyes towards Subaru.</p>

            <p>"Like Lady Ram, I too have no sympathy for Lord Shubaruts," Tanzo said. "Since I do not understand the situation, please do not misunderstand thinking that I am on your side."</p>

            <p>"I get it. Tanzo, you're always severe with me. I'm not thinking you're on my side."</p>

            <p>"........."</p>

            <p>"Huh? Did you get a little upset? Why?"</p>

            <p>Mimicking Ram, Tanzo, who had just declared his impartiality, showed a slightly disgruntled look. Although Tanzo was usually expressionless, this was the face he frequently resorts to. It often occurred during Cecilus's reckless actions or when Hearst spoke a little too much. Also, it happened quite often with Subaru.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, thanks to Ram and Tanzo's declarations of where they stood, the mindset was settled down.</p>

            <p>Subaru then turned to face Rem and Louis, the main parties of this discussion.</p>

            <p>"And so...," he began. "Louis, I'm going to talk about something important. All about you and what I've been feeling inside, without hiding anything. Will you listen without running away?"</p>

            <p>"...Eh-uh!"</p>

            <p>"I see. Good girl. Thank you."</p>

            <p>After a moment's hesitation, Louis bounced her voice affirmatively. Her response was again proof that she understood the conversation around her. Rem was watching her, eyes wandering on Louis's profile.</p>

            <p>Rem, hoping to see the emotions she desired in Louis's reaction, might have interrupted the conversation had Louis shown any sign of reluctance. But she found no such reason in Louis's profile.</p>

            <p>"Rem and Louis, I think you both understand. From the start, I've always been cautious about Louis, always distrusted her… and always disliked her."</p>

            <p>"........."</p>

            <p>"The reason why Rem was initially overly skeptical of me too, it was the biggest cause. Trying to separate the two of them, my finger was even broken."</p>

            <p>"Back then... I too, went overboard."</p>

            <p>"It's fine. Now that I think about it, that's a good memory between me and Rem."</p>

            <p>"Hah?"Subaru answered, bending his left hand's fingers. Seeing this, Rem looked at him as if questioning his sanity. Not only Rem, but also Ram and Tanz questioned him, which made Subaru feel crushed even while talking about his broken fingers. So, before his spirit would be broken, Subaru abruptly changed the subject.</p>

            <p>"I was extremely wary about Louis. And Rem, you were really suspicious of me. I don't know how Louis was feeling, but the tension was palpable, wasn't it?"</p>

            <p>"Huh?"</p>

            <p>"Even when we got separated once and then reunited with everyone from Shudrak, and even when we fled back from Guarl and attacked it again, it was like that the whole time."</p>

            <p>That's why an insurmountable gap had come to exist between Subaru and Rem.</p>

            <p>There was no doubt that a major reason why Subaru despised Louis was that her presence had contributed to the deterioration of his relationship with Rem.</p>

            <p>However, his negative feelings towards Louis began to change after he separated from Rem and headed toward the demon city Chaos Flame, and after the events that took place there. Subaru was forced to accept Louis when they spent time together without Rem, and she tried to protect him with her self-sacrifice.</p>

            <p>That's why, after they separated in the demon city, when he reunited with Beatrice in the imperial capital, he was sincerely happy that Louis was there. At that point, the initial negative feelings were nowhere to be found.</p>

            <p>"If we could have casually and nonchalantly gone on without thinking deeply about it, it would have been a relief, I think. But that's impossible. It's like a wound. There are wounds that heal if left alone, and wounds that get worse if left untreated. This is the kind of wound that needs attention."</p>

            <p>In order to heal a wound, treatment is necessary.</p>

            <p>And a treatment may not only rely on magic or medicine, sometimes it's necessary to use a daring method.</p>

            <p>This is also the type of wound that requires this.</p>

            <p>That's why--</p>

            <p>"I've never told you why I disliked you, Louis," he said for the first time.</p>

            <p>"Huh...?"</p>

            <p>With those words, Subaru stared at her, looking deep into her blue eyes as he expressed his feelings. In response to his serious gaze and words, Louis did not look away, ready to accept whatever he would say. But then--</p>

            <p>"...Please stop,"</p>

            <p>It was Rem who pleaded in a trembling voice, biting her lower lip.As if pleading, she said so with a trembling voice, her hand still holding onto Louie's. - No, that was wrong. It wasn't that. Louie wasn't the one being held. It was Rem. Rem was the one being held by Louie, and she knew that.</p>

            <p>"I don't want to hear it. I couldn't care less about the reason you hated Louie. It's fine if you're just heartless."</p>

            <p>Reluctantly, weakly shaking her head, Rem rejected Subaru's words. As much as she could, she avoided putting strength into her grip on the hand she laid over Louie's, and tightly held onto the opposing hand instead—the bone-grinding grasp signaling her intent to resist what came next.</p>

            <p>She wanted to respect Rem's feelings. She wanted to fulfill whatever Rem was wishing for.</p>

            <p>"I'm sorry. I can't let you close your ears to this."</p>

            <p>But, she couldn't. She couldn't grant Rem's wish or respect her feelings. All Rem could do in this room was to bolt out and refuse to listen. If she really did that, Subaru had no right to stop her.</p>

            <p>But Rem knew. She knew that closing her ears to Subaru's words in this place would mean turning her back on her own fragmented "memories" —</p>

            <p>"…"</p>

            <p>And betray the feelings of Ram, who was silently watching over her.</p>

            <p>"Still, I don't want to… I don't want to listen…"</p>

            <p>Clutching her eyes shut and grinding her teeth, Rem chose not to run away from here. But, the words to be spoken by Subaru prompted a deep, deep sense of rejection. His words hardened her heart, and Subaru, too, could not take his eyes off Louie.</p>

            <p>"Uwa."</p>

            <p>Louie's lips moved, making a sound rather than a word. The sound was calling his name, "Subaru," and he knew that. He just knew.</p>

            <p>"Louie, the reason I hated...loathed you, was"</p>

            <p>"Stop…."</p>

            <p>"It was because you were the main culprit who stole Rem's 'memories,' the Archbishop of Gluttony.”</p>

            <p>Because he knew, Subaru had to respond to it.</p>

            <p>△▼△▼▼△▼△</p>

            <p>He said it. Those unsaid words, at last.The moment his secret had been revealed, there was neither the profound emotion of unburdening nor the exhilarating sensation of accusing a detested adversary. Instead, what lingered was a torment that grew weightier and bitterer, even after he had purged the feelings he had kept confined within his heart. This despair only escalated as the subsequent events unfolded.</p>

            <p>"Arghhhhh!"</p>

            <p>A piercing scream rent the air as Rem reached out, her face contorting with emotion. The moment her hand clenched the front of Subaru's shirt, he found himself forcefully shoved down, his feeble attempts at resistance futile as she climbed onto him. Even if he were not in his reduced state, he likely wouldn't have been able to resist, but his current diminutive form made it impossible.</p>

            <p>If Rem truly exerted all her might, she could easily seal Subaru's mouth with her bare hands. But until a decisive word was uttered, she refrained from doing so - even when she had straddled him just now.</p>

            <p>"Why... why is this happening..."</p>

            <p>Straining her voice, her face crumpled from the raw surge of emotion within her, she did not resort to brute force, even while glaring into Subaru's face from a breath's distance. Despite her intense outburst, Rem retained an element of rationality at the very end.</p>

            <p>"……"</p>

            <p>Subaru, feeling her hot breath wash over his face, pacified those around them with an outstretched hand. The moment Subaru was forced to the ground, Tanzo instinctively reacted to protect him, but Ram restrained him — something Subaru saw out of his peripheral vision. He signaled to both that it was alright, all the while staring into Rem's eyes.</p>

            <p>From her pale blue eyes, teardrops fell onto Subaru’s cheeks, thick with an overwhelming sense of helplessness. It was neither from anger nor sadness. Instead, they were filled with the unfathomable emotion that kept her last shred of rationality intact.</p>

            <p>"I knew it, even without you telling me... I knew that Louie had something to do with the memories I can't recall...!"</p>

            <p>"Rem..."</p>

            <p>"Because there's no other explanation! The reason why you kept treating Louie so harshly, why you kept trying to keep her away from me — it has to be because it's dangerous for me to be around Louie, right? That's the only explanation..."</p>

            <p>With every shaky breath she took, her voice and eyes trembled weakly as Rem laid bare her inner turmoil. Listening to her, Subaru closed his eyes. It was as he had expected.It was none other than Rem herself who was the victim of this lost "memory". It's impossible that she, above anyone else – above Subaru and everyone else – would not care about her own "memory". She must have agonized over the whereabouts of her "memory" more than anyone.</p>

            <p>"Do you think I’m stupid? Maybe I am, just an ignorant, stupid woman. I know nothing about you, nor do I want to know! Yet, you keep intruding... I hate you!"</p>

            <p>"........."</p>

            <p>"You can't even compare to Louis. Louis has always been with me, caring about me... That Louis, is my..."</p>

            <p>Endless tears not only struck Subaru's cheek but also decorated Rem's cheek and chin, and adorned her body and heart with droplets of tears, deceiving her.</p>

            <p>She knew it, yet she wished to pretend not to know it.</p>

            <p>"It's all a mistake, all a lie..."</p>

            <p>"Rem..."</p>

            <p>"Ah..."</p>

            <p>With a weak murmur, Rem's eyes flickered with tears. When a large tear fell, her blurred vision must have momentarily cleared, allowing her to see Subaru's face.</p>

            <p>Subaru, who was pushed down, gently cradled Rem's face in his hands, causing her to fix her gaze onto him. As black eyes and blue eyes intersected, Subaru spoke to her tear-soaked face.</p>

            <p>"It's not a lie. Everything that Rem thought is correct... Louis was our enemy."</p>

            <p>"What...or who is this enemy? Is it because they did something to my memories? If so...if so!"</p>

            <p>Forcefully shaking her head, Rem pulled away from Subaru's hands and got up. She then turned to face Louis, who was still standing in the spot they started at.</p>

            <p>"If so, I... I will forgive Louis. I will, so... isn't that enough? See, that solves everything, doesn't it?"</p>

            <p>"No, it's not. That doesn't solve anything."</p>

            <p>"Why not!!"</p>

            <p>"Because...I would never forgive Louis for making you suffer."</p>

            <p>With a cracking voice, Subaru declared this to Rem, who had just claimed she would forgive Louis.Hearing Subaru's words, Rem gasped with wide-open eyes, her breath rasping. Suddenly, the strength drained from Rem's body, and Subaru slowly raised himself.</p>

            <p>Still with Rem on top of him, Subaru sat upright, his presence in close proximity to her. "It's not just me. Ram and everyone else who cherishes Rem, none of us will forgive Louis, no matter what you say."</p>

            <p>"Is th-that so…"</p>

            <p>"Moreover, Rem, what Louis has done… It doesn’t just concern you. A lot, too many people are suffering because of what Louis has done, the sin of 'Gluttony'."</p>

            <p>Even if Rem really forgives Louis, or forgives her out of true mercy, there are simply far too many other "Rems" in this world who cannot forgive Louis.</p>

            <p>Unless these people are saved, Rem's desperate pleas will bear no fruit.</p>

            <p>"… There are others, too?"</p>

            <p>"Yeah. An unimaginably vast number of people are suffering."</p>

            <p>"Then... then, there's nothing we can do, right?"</p>

            <p>"------"</p>

            <p>"From the start, isn’t it a problem that we can't do anything about? Are you saying that by expressing this impossibility... that is your resolution?"</p>

            <p>Her lips trembling in small spasms, tears the size of large drops began to fall from Rem's eyes again.</p>

            <p>Stronger than her pain over her own "memories", Rem cried over Louis.</p>

            <p>She wanted to save Louis more than her own "memories", she wanted him to be saved, according to her emotional state, Rem shivered her lips. She shed tears.</p>

            <p>Subaru experienced a crushing pain in response to those tears and her trembling voice.</p>

            <p>"Sorry, I was messing around."</p>

            <p>"… Please don’t apologize."</p>

            <p>"But, I'm sorry. For Rem, all I can do is say things that will make her feel pain and suffering."</p>

            <p>"So, please don’t apologize...! I, I don't want to hear it...!"</p>

            <p>"I'm sorry, but listen to me."</p>

            <p>"No…!"</p>

            <p>"I don't want to give up. -- I don't want to keep resenting Louis."</p>

            <p>"Eh…"</p>

            <p>A small gasp escaped from Rem's throat, and her eyes widened.</p>

            <p>In front of Rem, Subaru took a deep breath and licked his lips, phrase by phrase, communicating his thoughts clearly to those who wanted to hear it."I feel the same as Rem. I want to forgive Louis. I don't want to keep blaming Louis. But, it's impossible. After all, Rem matters to me," Subaru confessed.</p>

            <p>"---!"</p>

            <p>"And because of that, I can't forgive Louis... who hurt Rem badly, stole Rem's 'memory,' and is causing Rem such suffering even now."</p>

            <p>Subaru gently wiped away the tear that streamed down Rem's cheek with his finger. Many tears glistened on Rem's cheeks, but still, she didn't flinch away from Subaru's touch. He hadn't been rejected, so Subaru continued to speak.</p>

            <p>"I've been scolded countless times, for speaking foolishly, for thinking irrationally... Even now, I'm sure Otto thinks everything would be settled if Louis were dead."</p>

            <p>But that was a natural thought to have. They all understood in their minds that this was, though not a self-purification process, a necessary conclusion. Subaru understood too, and that's why he resisted vehemently. Nevertheless,---</p>

            <p>"Julius told me this. He's an incredible guy, but he might also be a complete fool. Despite being a fellow victim just like Rem, he said something unbelievable. He's a fool."</p>

            <p>"------"</p>

            <p>"I've been told various things by the wise and the foolish... by the cool guys, kind-hearted girls, and incredible people. I've thought about it, a lot. And made a decision. This is where I draw the line."</p>

            <p>"Draw the... line..."</p>

            <p>"I want to trust Louis. I want to forgive her... But I can't forgive her immediately."</p>

            <p>With those words, while looking at the shivering eyes of Rem in front of him, a phrase told to him by a certain man crossed Subaru's mind.</p>

            <p>"Who could ever accept someone who toyed with lives based purely on a whim?"</p>

            <p>Words spoken by a disapproving man dug painfully into Natsuki Subaru's soul. He acknowledged that having an attitude of allowing or disallowing, based on whimsical likes or dislikes, is not worth believing in. Those words were probably right. The one most untrustworthy is, Subaru's own heart.</p>

            <p>Even so, he would negotiate with this heart, which he couldn't surrender to anyone, and continue forward. With such a fragile and pathetic soul that easily gets swayed and quick to change positions, he would negotiate.</p>

            <p>"---Ah!"</p>

            <p>Reacting with surprise to Subaru's statement, Rem, who had been frozen in shock, was then tightly embraced by Subaru.Subaru, despite their height difference, pulled himself out from under her body, bending so as to hold the collapsed Rem's head in his lap. He cradly wrapped her frail form within his arms, genuinely and deeply hoping to convey how much he cherished her.</p>

            <p>And then—</p>

            <p>“—Uauau"</p>

            <p>Upon hearing that sound, the called-upon Subaru turned his gaze toward Louis. Having been let go by Rem, Louis - who had been standing frozen on the spot - called for Subaru, understanding that her turn had come.</p>

            <p>"Uu..."</p>

            <p>Looking quite desolate as she stood, Louis caused Rem, who had been embraced by Subaru, to let out a soft gasp before she hurriedly stood up. Then, Rem hugged Louis from the front.</p>

            <p>"S-Sorry, Louis-chan...We, we...on our own..."</p>

            <p>"Au, uau, a-au"</p>

            <p>"I'm sorry…"</p>

            <p>Feebly apologizing, Rem wiped her own face with her sleeve and stood beside Louis. Furthermore, she tightly gripped Louis' hand, yet not with a face seeking comfort. Rem felt a twinge of jealousy stirring within her heart once again for Louis, who had stirred her emotions.</p>

            <p>Then, Subaru continued—</p>

            <p>“ – Louis, do you still want to be me?”</p>

            <p>"…. U?"</p>

            <p>"...What are you...talking about?"</p>

            <p>Upon hearing Subaru’s question, neither of them seemed to grasp its meaning, both tilting their heads in confusion. Not just Rem, but Louis as well. Indeed, “Louis” did the same.</p>

            <p>"Just like what I told Rem earlier. Even if Rem forgives you, I won't forgive Louis. The many others who fell victim to 'Gluttony' won't forgive Louis either. But,"</p>

            <p>"… But?"</p>

            <p>"But, Louis, I want to forgive you. If I can, I want to. Now, tell me."</p>

            <p>Making sure his voice did not waver, Subaru stares directly at Louis. He observes as Rem tightly grips Louis’ hand, and Louis, in turn, squeezes back. He prays that this exchange signifies the answer to their relationship.</p>

            <p>"Are you a Sin Archbishop? Or are you...a possibility?"</p>

            <p>"------"</p>

            <p>"It's been said over and over. I've also thought about it. This world can't, and shouldn't, forgive the Sin Archbishops. The Great Sin Archbishop of Gluttony, Louis Arneb, is a presence that can't be forgiven."</p>

            <p>"------"
            "But you've helped me. You've protected me time and time again. You don't even know how you wanted to become me. You are nothing like the Louis Arneb I knew. Yet, you can still use the 'Gluttony' ability. You have the Witch Factor." That was Subaru's whole impression of the "Louis" he has spent time with so far. Despite having the same appearance and same ability as the Great Sin Archbishop, Louis Arneb whom he encountered in the "Corridor of Memories", her attitude is unrecognizable. It's like the "Natsuki Subaru" from some time ago, the "Rem" who is here now. The same, yet different. Something that can choose its own path of being the same, and yet different.</p>

            <p>He wanted to pose a question to such a "Louis".</p>

            <p>"Are you the Great Sin Archbishop who cannot forgive anyone in this world? Or are you a possibility that might unravel what the Archbishop has done?"</p>

            <p>"Ah, uu.."</p>

            <p>"Can you... can you start life anew?"</p>

            <p>If, just if. If the situation "Louis" is in is the same as "Natsuki Subaru" or "Rem", then the question Subaru is throwing is terribly cruel and unreasonable. Subaru knows the pain of having debts not of oneself, without any recollection or foresight, pressing upon oneself. Rem understands it too. And now, he is attempting to inflict the same onto Louis. But ---</p>

            <p>"If you can do that, if you desire it, take my hand."</p>

            <p>As he said so, Subaru slowly extended his hand to Louis. Louis' eyes flickered between Subaru's face and his extended hand. Similarly, Rem, who was gasping next to the girl, followed Subaru's eyes and hand with her gaze.</p>

            <p>"Louis, many people are cursing you in the same way as me. I cannot represent the feelings of all those people. But, just one thing."</p>

            <p>"------"</p>

            <p>"I don't know what you can do to be forgiven by everyone. However... however, I can tell you what you need to do to be forgiven by me."</p>

            <p>Before coming here, before getting the approval to spend this time, Emilia said. Emilia said that Subaru told her, but that's ridiculous. Subaru has always been the one being taught by everyone."I could not figure out how to sort out my feelings unless it was explained to me- why Subaru wanted to forgive Louis, how he could go through with it, everything. The method to find where to draw the line was..." 
            
            "Louis, save many lives." 
            
            There was no response.</p>

            <p>"Right now, you're experiencing something cruel and unreasonable. You may feel as though you're being forced to bear an outrageous cross for something you have no memory of. But even so,"</p>

            <p>Taking a deep breath, looking at Louis with steadfast eyes, he conveyed: 
            
            "Help as many people as you can." 
            
            Still no reaction.</p>

            <p>"Keep helping them, keep going and if you can keep assisting more than you've taken... At least I, myself, will stand by you."</p>

            <p>The wrongdoing, absolutely, will never disappear.</p>

            <p>This is what Anastasia had said to Subaru, immediately before and in the past, the utterance that had frozen Subaru solid.</p>

            <p>It was a warning equivalent to a trauma for Subaru, it had taught him that there are things that even his "Return by Death" can never overturn, currently, he thought of those words.</p>

            <p>However, Anastasia had also said this at the time of that proclamation:</p>

            <p>"If you want others to believe in your righteousness, you must show them something of equal weight. To change an evaluation, nothing will work but to overturn it with a different one."</p>

            <p>That was indeed, the most important part of the caution that had traumatized Subaru. Now Subaru is reaching out to Louis because her actions had overturned the negative feelings he harbored.</p>

            <p>To induce the same emotional transformation in everyone who had suffered from the "Gluttony" as what had occurred within Subaru.</p>

            <p>That was-</p>

            <p>"That is the 'From Zero' I can prepare for you."</p>

            <p>Far from zero, she had to start from a negative on a global scale. An absurd problem on an enormous scale, incomprehensibly, indescribably so. Who would believe such an overblown delusion could be accomplished?</p>

            <p>But, that's the best Subaru could come up with.</p>

            <p>If this absurd problem on an enormous scale, incomprehensibly, indescribably so, seemed like an overblown delusion unknowable to all, Subaru would aid her through it. Just like how someone had done the same for none other than Natsuki Subaru.
            
            No response.Still extending his hand, Subaru waits silently for an answer. He doesn't rush, nor does he wait indefinitely. He patiently continues to wait as long as necessary for the required answer.</p>

            <p>"I...don't know."</p>

            <p>In the middle of this silence, standing beside Subaru and Rui who have fallen silent, Rem murmur those words. For a moment, it was thought to be a statement refusing Subaru's proposition. However, her gaze spoke otherwise.</p>

            <p>She continues.</p>

            <p>"About this so-called Sin Archbishop, about this person named Louis Arneb, everything..."</p>

            <p>"----"</p>

            <p>"But, if this Sin Archbishop, this human being Louis Arneb, is not allowed to exist in this world...then what does this child become?"</p>

            <p>Her voice was shaking. But, her thin, blue eyes didn't hold any tears. She claimed that a moist, blurred vision couldn't properly see the answer she desired, nor the one offered by the other party, hence Rem's gaze was straight.</p>

            <p>If she chooses not to be the Sin Archbishop or Louis Arneb, then what can she become? Bearing countless unreasonable burdens as "Louis," she walks a path seeking forgiveness on the other side, unclear if it exists or not. What could such a girl become?</p>

            <p>Asked so, the words Subaru could return were------</p>

            <p>"----Spica"</p>

            <p>"Huh...?"</p>

            <p>"As this child tries to live a new life, living as a new self, this is the name I would like to offer."</p>

            <p>Rem's eyes widen at his words, and Louis' eyes also replicate the same surprise. If she chooses to live differently than before, aiming for a wholly different future, Subaru intends to do everything he can for her.</p>

            <p>In a world where no one forgives the Sin Archbishop, where no one forgives Louis Arneb, Subaru truly wishes to forgive the girl in front of him from the bottom of his heart. He wishes for her to become someone, something, that Subaru himself can forgive.</p>

            <p>"Spica..."</p>

            <p>Astonishingly, Rem muttered the name, her gaze turning to the girl. The girl remained silent, staring at Subaru. Subaru too, without faltering, stared back at the girl.</p>

            <p>He has a longing for things to work out. However, if he expressed these feelings, the girl would undoubtedly abide by them, respecting Subaru's desires instead of her own. So, he chose to remain silent.
            "I hope you choose not for someone's sake, but for your own. I hope that after you've walked and walked and kept walking, when you look back down that path, you can think 'I chose and have been walking this path on my own'."</p>

            <p>"--- Uauu"</p>

            <p>"-----"</p>

            <p>The girl's thin lips moved. Subaru's name was softly called out.</p>

            <p>Subaru patiently waits in silence. He doesn't want to hurry her, nor will he wait forever. He wants to hear her answer, the thing she has chosen, after taking the necessary time.</p>

            <p>In doing this, Subaru, who is desperately suppressing himself, noticed a change in the girl's expression.</p>

            <p>"Auuuauu"</p>

            <p>The words she wove together were soft and gentle, as was the smile that surfaced.</p>

            <p>And then, from her blue eyes, from those corners where the tears trailed down and fell, the girl's hand gently held out Subaru's hand.</p>

            <p>Greeting that thin, soft sensation, Subaru closed his eyes tightly.</p>

            <p>A way of life that is neither the 'Bishop of Sins' nor 'Louis Arneb.' An irremovable past as both the Bishop of Sins and Louis Arneb.</p>

            <p>Embracing all of that, the girl who is to walk a thorny path - "Spica" has her hand tightly gripped, as if to never let go.</p>

            <p>"I want to forgive you someday. ---So, let's try our best together."</p>

            <p>".....Auu!"</p>

            <p>With a wide smile showing her white teeth, Spica tearfully laughed.</p>

            <p>Rem, who was peeking at Spica's smiling face from the side, felt her emotions swell until they burst.</p>

            <p>"---"</p>

            <p>Rem, who had cried hot and many tears more than ever before, hugged Spica.</p>

            <p>Hugging her and holding her, Rem cried aloud. Led by Rem's crying, Spica, surprised by the hug, looked gloomy and crumpled her face,</p>

            <p>"---Aaaaaauu!"</p>

            <p>Spica too, with a big voice and a crumpled face, displaying an age-appropriate demeanor while carrying an age-inappropriate fate, began to cry.</p>

            <p>Like a new life bawling on entering this world, like everyone else.</p>

            <p>Like a newborn's first cry, the girls kept crying. They kept crying.</p>

            <p>--- Subaru also cried a little.</p>
