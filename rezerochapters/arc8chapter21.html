        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>The bar was filled with a thick scent of alcohol and the smell of earth. Stacked near the entrance were emptied bottles and barrels of alcohol, and the remnants of clay dolls, shaped like humans once.</p>

            <p>The people who piled up those things were two middle-aged men exchanging banter loosening up in the interior of the bar.</p>

            <p>"Oh? This fellow looks familiar. Isn't it the red-haired one? Do you know him, the one with the hairball!"</p>

            <p>"Who the hell are you calling a hairball?! Shut up with your crappy jokes! I've been running around without eating or drinking, I am so damn exhausted...!"</p>

            <p>Groovy snaps back at the humorous, red-faced man spanking his thighs merrily. The blue middle-aged man, who had gathered his hair at the back of his head, started laughing even more cheerfully at Groovy's tirade, responding with "unavoidable, unavoidable." It was clear that the alcohol was getting to him in an undesirable way.</p>

            <p>Dismissing the blue middle-aged man as a hopeless case, he turns to look at the red-haired man, sitting silently in his chair and glaring at his bottle.</p>

            <p>"Oi! Red-haired bastard! Are you the same as this blue-haired idiot?"</p>

            <p>"————"</p>

            <p>"Don't ignore me! Stop that damn silence, look here...!"</p>

            <p>"——Shut up."</p>

            <p>As soon as he tried to retort, a silver flash of retaliation burst out. The red-haired man's strike was aimed squarely at Groovy's neck while he sat in his chair. Much like when he first appeared, the red-haired man's technique aiming for his vital spots was accurate. It could have inflicted a fatal wound if it hadn't been Groovy.</p>

            <p>"Who the hell are you picking a fight with, you bastard?!"</p>

            <p>Nimbly dodging the sword strike that skimmed past his nose, Groovy's fist groaned as he aimed a punch, encased in a gauntlet, at the red-haired man's side. The impact sent the red-haired man flying into a wall.</p>

            <p>With a groan of agony, the red-haired man's body spun mid-air, crashing into the wall without bracing himself. While he tumbled, Groovy grabbed a spinning bottle from the air.</p>

            <p>The alcohol that the red-haired man was drinking, Groovy chugs it down liberally.</p>

            <p>"Gah! Damn, it burns...! I really wanted water and food though..."</p>

            <p>""Brilliant, absolutely brilliant! Oh my, such competence you've got indeed, Mr. Hairball. I assumed that redhead had substantial abilities, yet you brushed him off like nothing. Truly surprising!"</p>

            <p>"Huh?"</p>

            <p>Ignoring the red middle-aged man hanging upside-down from the wall, the blue middle-aged man heavily plunked down on his knees, sheathing his blade as if to say, 'I give up.' He assumed a formal kneeling position and lowered his head in deep respect, praising Groovy's strength while demonstrating he had no intention to fight any further through his posture.</p>

            <p>"We've caused you a great deal of trouble, furry one! We are mere vagabonds who casually stumbled upon this settlement. However, by the time we arrived, the village was in this state —occupied by hordes of clay figures, with not a single villager in sight."</p>

            <p>"So, you damned bastards were drinking all the leftover alcohol because you had no other choice, huh?"</p>

            <p>"Well, much to our shame, that's exactly what happened! And not being satisfied with that, we started betting on whether the next clay figure to slip through the door would be male or female."</p>

            <p>While happily laughing, the blue middle-aged man spilled the beans about their absurd betting game, which they weren’t considering seriously at all. It was ridiculous, but if they were wagering with ownerless alcohol and their own lives, Groovy couldn't say much. Where they lived or died was their own business.</p>

            <p>However...</p>

            <p>"I don't like it."</p>

            <p>"Huh, why's that?"</p>

            <p>"You sheathe your sword, kneel down, and pull a face saying you have no intention to fight, but don’t think you can fool my nose.,. Don’t scrutinize me with a murderous intent, bastard."</p>

            <p>"......"</p>

            <p>When Groovy glared at him snorting, the blue middle-aged man scratched his cheek, saying, "Well..." He couldn’t deny it, not because words failed him in the moment, but probably because he realized a quick excuse might rile Groovy up.</p>

            <p>This blue middle-aged man had been hiding his murderous intent behind words and deeds ever since the red man was taken down, or even before that. In a place where he’d taken refuge from the pursuing clay figures, he found himself entangled with a troublesome opponent - that's when Groovy realized something.</p>

            <p>"Your stink... I remember it."</p>

            <p>He recalled the scent somewhere, all his fur standing upright. He didn't claim to remember every scent he'd smelled, but distinctive ones were hard to forget. Trying to remember the man's identity based on his sour odor mixed with the heavy intent to kill, he said -</p>

            <p>"Are you by any chance the damned father of that bastard Cecilus?"</p>

            <p>Voicing the memories that came to mind, Groovy glared at his counterpart sharply. To Groovy's piercing gaze, the middle-aged man in blue cringed visibly and answered,</p>

            <p>"Oh dear, you've remembered."</p>

            <p>"Damn it! Are you trying to kill me because you don't want that to be known?! You must be joking! Besides, why are you still alive?! You were supposedly slain by Cecilus!"</p>

            <p>"Even if you ask why, there's no other way to say it than because I'm still living. Having said that, it is quite inconvenient that my survival is known."</p>

            <p>With a nonchalant shake of his head, the middle-aged man in blue responded cheekily— that man was the father of Cecilus Segmunt, the "First" of the "Nine Gods." In the past, he would regularly visit the Crystal Palace with Cecilus, so Groovy had crossed paths with him a few times. However, it was said that he had committed an act of irreverence in the palace years ago, and was cut down by his own son, Cecilus, and was assumed to be dead.</p>

            <p>"I'm on a wanted poster, the part about me being dead must be a misunderstanding."</p>

            <p>"I just didn't expect Cecilus to mess up, that's all. If that crap, who's good only with a sword, messes up, he's just crap. Don't tell me he showed mercy because you're his father."</p>

            <p>"There's no such thing. There's no way his sword would dull due to parent-child affection."</p>

            <p>"......"</p>

            <p>Groovy held back the biting words at the outright declaration. He didn't know much about the relationship between the middle-aged man in blue before him and the father-son relationship with Cecilus. However, he is the father who raised Cecilus to be the way he is, it wasn't hard to imagine he's an unfit man.</p>

            <p>If he claimed that his skill didn't dull after cutting down his own father, it could be believed. But...</p>

            <p>"Damn..."</p>

            <p>After being chased and running away continuously, he finally met a living person, only to find they were a pair of drunken men —one a wanted criminal, the other a drunkard.</p>

            <p>Cursing his terrible luck, he felt on the verge of breaking down.</p>

            <p>"Oh, huh, hm..."</p>

            <p>"Oh, the redhead is still alive too. The fuzzy man is kind."</p>

            <p>"...I didn't exactly spare him. That redhead brute is just tough, that's all."</p>

            <p>The red-headed drunkard, sprawled on his back by the wall, was choking on the vomit surging from his mouth, yet he held on from Groovy's blow intended to pulp his insides.Even in his decrepit state, he could take down these middle-aged men of red and blue -- but the world beyond their fight was growing loud and chaotic.</p>

            <p>"Seems things are getting unruly outside..."</p>

            <p>The blue middle-aged man murmured, true to his words, the loathsome smell of wet earth was creeping into their village. Apparently, a sizable group had surrounded their secret region, intending to corner the escaped Groovy. The scent of the slowly closing net of enemies filled his nostrils and rang a bell of distress in Groovy’s mind.</p>

            <p>Kill these middle-aged men, break through the encirclement with all his might, find someone amongst these drunkards who's somewhat up to the task, and make enough time to put water and food in his belly. But was such an idealistic plan really realistic? Moreover...</p>

            <p>"You bastard... Let's negotiate."</p>

            <p>"I am all ears."</p>

            <p>The blue middle-aged man, politely sitting with his knees under him, kept his katana beside him and became solemn. It was disgustingly ironic how just moments ago, this man, in the same composure, was ready to kill Groovy. Although he wished to vent his irritation, the deadly intent in the air had subsided.</p>

            <p>Despite his annoyance, Groovy said: "No matter what, I have to return to his place. Even if it means using bastards like you. So..."</p>

            <p>"........"</p>

            <p>"I'll erase your warrants or whatever it may be with the authority of a general. In return, you will help me return to the capital."</p>

            <p>This was a desperate measure for Groovy.</p>

            <p>If he were in his best state, he would never resort to such a man. But what would be gained if he stubbornly fought and fell?</p>

            <p>"The bastard who created this damn mess..."</p>

            <p>To be honest, he sensed something shady behind this civil war shaking the Volachian Empire.</p>

            <p>As for being distanced from the capital himself, there was the plausible reason of caution on the western side, but he had a slight hunch that there were other motives Minister Vincent could have had.</p>

            <p>He had obediently followed it because he thought it was okay to believe in Vincent's judgment.</p>

            <p>And now, to hear the answer to his trust, Groovy must return.</p>

            <p>That is why...</p>

            <p>"Choose whether to accept the negotiation, you bastard!"</p>

            <p>Groovy barked, baring his teeth, while the blue middle-aged man squinted one eye, seemingly deep in thought.</p>

            <p>Before the unreadable man could give his answer, a loud crash sounded behind Groovy as the door of the tavern was torn open from outside.
            With the momentum of breaking through the door, pale-faced clay dolls rushed in. Just as their hands reached out for the diminutive Groovy— a flash of the sword swept past.</p>

            <p>The slashing attack of the unsheathed sword bisected the clay dolls' bodies from their necks, turning them into clumps of earth. The middle-aged man who had done so sheathed his blade in a fluid motion and stood up. Rubbing his stubbled, flushed face with his empty hand, he asked:</p>

            <p>"How much would the reward be, along with erasing my criminal record?"</p>

            <p>"You're really a piece of shit, aren't you…"</p>

            <p>Taking the audacious question as an answer, Groovy exhaled a long breath. As his sight began to spin…</p>

            <p>"Damn…"</p>

            <p>…his consciousness sank into the murky depths, overwhelmed by an inevitable limit of his physical strength.</p>

            <p>"Sigh, such a charming bloke, dozing off and leaving the details till later,"</p>

            <p>A small beast-human, who collapsed on the spot, began to snore loudly. Looking down at Groovy Gumlett, one of the prime warriors of the Volachian Empire known as the "Nine Divine Generals," Rowan Segmunt with his reddened face, scrunches his brow.</p>

            <p>Though Groovy is not the kind of person to renege on a verbal agreement. The terms offered earlier were indeed worth considering. Of course, if he were to consider continuous escape, he could just stab the sleeping Groovy's heart and continue his life on the run.</p>

            <p>"But who would that serve," he murmured. "Rather, I should take this as my luck turning around — ready for the third act of my life!"</p>

            <p>Stamping his feet firmly on the ground, Rowan winced at his slightly cramped left foot but chuckled, realizing there was no need to turn back.</p>

            <p>Nonetheless, the priority was to get out of this place alive. Sensing the earthen remnants beginning to gather around the pub, he quickly hoisted Groovy onto his shoulder.</p>

            <p>Then, he kicked at his upside-down partner, Heinkel, who was facing the wall.</p>

            <p>"Hey, redhead, wake up! The situation has changed!"</p>

            <p>"Huh…?"</p>

            <p>"It pains me to leave you behind! If you're at the end of your rope, why not gamble and turn things around with me here!"</p>

            <p>As he spoke out loud, Heinkel's eyes reluctantly opened. Seeing Rowan rushing towards him in his upside-down view along with the carried Groovy, he swung his feet lightly to return from the inverted state, immediately staggering as if dizzy.</p>

            <p>"What... I feel sick..."</p>

            <p>"One strike from you and the answer is too much. Now, we've just about drained the liquor here, it's about time we drift to the next place."</p>

            <p>"...What about that beastman? Are you going to eat him?"</p>

            <p>"If we're struggling to eat, perhaps. But right now, we have no such intention. In any case..."</p>

            <p>He wiped the liquor stained around his lips with his sleeve, and slapped Heinkel, who was staggering, on the back. Then, Rowan once again hoisted Groovy's body and turned back around.</p>

            <p>A swarm of men rushed into the bar all at once. With a single hand, Rowan cut the sheath of his katana, laughing and saying,</p>

            <p>"Wait for us alive, Dragon-boy. The Sky Sword is still a far way off."</p>

            <p>△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>Two rays of light pave the way out of the "Great Calamity."</p>

            <p>This was the prophecy, or fate as they would say, brought by "Stargazer" Ubilk, who was bound by chains in Volachian Empire.</p>

            <p>Ubilk's statements, a "Stargazer" who had made invaluable predictions for the Volachian Empire and forecasted many events, dealt a massive blow to Subaru.</p>

            <p>To be honest, Subaru isn't a huge believer in prophecies or predictions. He has a notion that such things are a kind of scam using various psychological techniques. Of course, in this another world, phenomena beyond common reason may occur.</p>

            <p>When you think about it, the results Subaru gets from his "Return by Death" could be a way to avoid the worst possible future through foresightedness.</p>

            <p>He would be rather grateful if he could know the future without dying.</p>

            <p>- Anyway,</p>

            <p>"... A girl who doesn't speak a common language."</p>

            <p>He went so far as to correct himself that she was not a "Stargazer", trying to convey accurate information.</p>

            <p>Thinking of what this might mean, Subaru gasped.</p>

            <p>However, before Subaru could question its true meaning, Abel, standing beside him, directed a cold gaze at Ubilk and said,</p>

            <p>"One of the lights you spoke of, Groovy Gumlett, is dead."</p>

            <p>"Eh?"</p>

            <p>Ubilk's eyes widened in surprise as Abel made such a clear declaration. It's only natural. When told that the recipient of an important prophecy is dead, anyone would react this way. Subaru too was taken aback by Abel’s pronouncement.</p>

            <p>Disregarding Subaru and Ubilk's surprise, Abel crossed his arms, shrugged lightly and said, "So the grand prophecy we talked about came from the mouth of a dead man. It's a bit more disappointing than I had expected."</p>

            <p>"Hold on, hold on, hold on! Don’t say it as if it's true! We haven’t confirmed it yet!"</p>

            <p>"Fool. If there's no sign of joining our forces, it means he's as good as dead."</p>

            <p>"Stop equating 'as good as dead' with 'he's dead'! You have a bad habit of assuming the worst and killing people off in your head!"</p>

            <p>In response to Abel's statement, which seemed to make light of Ubilk's distress, Subaru snapped back at him. There was no particular need to deceive Ubilk right now, so this was a justified retort.</p>

            <p>Upon hearing Subaru and Abel's exchange, Ubilk visibly sighed with relief.</p>

            <p>"So, it means I can believe that Major Groovy is not dead, right?"</p>

            <p>"We haven't had contact with him for a while now, and there's no sign of the army he was supposed to have led toward the west. If the person who was supposed to command them is missing, it's constructive to assume he's dead."</p>

            <p>"What are you constructing, a graveyard?"</p>

            <p>Whether it was because he took Subaru's remark as sarcasm, a sharpness crept into Abel's gaze. However, Subaru stuck his tongue out in response, holding his ground, and turned to Ubilk. The reliability of this "Stargazer" was still questionable.</p>

            <p>"Ubilk, at the point when the stars spoke to you, was this Groovy person absolutely alive? If so, it'd make things easier to persuade him."</p>

            <p>"I'm sorry, but what the stars brought me was only the key information about the individuals who could resist the 'Great Disaster'. I can't ascertain whether they're alive or not."</p>

            <p>"The countermeasure against the 'Great Disaster' that the presumably deceased Groovy Gumlett possessed..."</p>

            <p>Subaru refrained from any more corrections out of frustration at the incessant talk of life and death, but Abel's muttered words held deep implications for what was to come. If we are to believe Ubilk's prophecy, then that specific something only possessed by Groovy should be the key element needed to halt this catastrophe. Additionally...</p>

            <p>"――Louis"</p>

            <p>If one of the two lights mentioned by Ubilk refers to the Imperial Army's General, Groovy Gumlett, then the other must be referring to her. Since being transported to Volachian Empire with Subaru and Rem, she has surmounted numerous hardships alongside them and joined his camp – Ubilk stated that this extraordinary girl, notorious amongst this world, was necessary to repel the disaster.</p>

            <p>Louis and Groovy, there must be something common between these two that would prove effective in defeating the "enemy".</p>

            <p>"Groovy Gumlett is referred to as a 'Cursed Toolmaker,' someone proficient with magic and curses, possessing the ability to create equipment incorporating these techniques."</p>

            <p>Presumably, he arrived at this thought process following Subaru's line of thinking. What Abel revealed in explanation was the unique skill that Groovy possessed; an irreplaceable asset and likely a reason he was chosen as one of the lights.</p>

            <p>"A General is naturally quite strong, isn't he?"</p>

            <p>"There's no doubt that he possesses strength. Among beastmen, his senses are particularly sharp, especially his sense of smell; no one in the empire surpasses him in that regard. However, considering the conditions offered by this 'Stargazer,' we should not focus on his abilities as a warrior."</p>

            <p>"I understand... Magic and curses, huh?"</p>

            <p>As for magic, Beatrice and Roswaal have already made progress. The presence of a core bug pervading the bodies of the corpse people, which is undoubtedly at the center of their creation mechanism, was revealed. However, neither of them were included in the lights spoken of by Ubilk. In essence, it is of merited attention not as a superior magic user but――,</p>

            <p>"―― as a curser."</p>

            <p>Subaru and Abel voiced simultaneously, their black irises intersecting. Subaru's conviction was bolstered by the fact that, not only he but Abel had arrived at the same conclusion. There's hardly any doubt that Groovy was chosen for his curses in dealing with the corpse people.</p>

            <p>In addition to the magic approach, introducing a curse-based approach would allow them to employ some effective measures against those corpse people. "Perhaps Olbart Dunkelkenn is the only one who knows about curses, apart from Groovy Gumlett. We need to gather those who are knowledgeable in this field urgently. What about you?"</p>

            <p>"Well, Beako knows a little, and I am still under a curse. I wonder how much Roswaal and my sister know..."</p>

            <p>"Hmm...Regardless of what is rumored, we will need to confer with them about what they know." Before, when Subaru was bitten by a pack of demon beasts called Ulgarms and cursed, it was rumored that the aftereffects were still festering within his body.</p>

            <p>Fortunately, it did not interfere with his daily life and was left untreated. However, it was a nagging curse, much like having an unidentified mole on his body.</p>

            <p>In any case, just as Abel suggested, he would need to gather everyone knowledgeable about curses and reach the knowledge that should've been given by the expert, Groovy.</p>

            <p>With that in mind, Abel adds quietly, "And above that,"</p>

            <p>"— Do you have an answer to what kind of advantage the girl's existence offers the Empire?"</p>

            <p>Naturally, the topic also reached Louis, and Abel's question was thrust at Subaru.</p>

            <p>"........."</p>

            <p>Closing his mouth, Subaru delayed his answer to Abel's question. However, after one pause, it became two and then three, and he still could not provide a clear answer. It was clear what he was being asked, and it was equally clear he did not have an answer, without any need for doubt.</p>

            <p>"At that place, where we understood Linger, I told you this. I've no intention to immediately execute the opponent who seems to be the Sin Archbishop," Abel spoke, shifting the topic back to Louis, effectively stepping in for the silent Subaru.</p>

            <p>At the end of their unbecoming brawl, Subaru and Abel had shared a Linger. In the course of that conversation, they had also touched on Louis. Abel had then indeed said that he would not punish Louis because of her true identity, but...</p>

            <p>"That belief has not changed. To define the girl, it is not I who should do so. You are the one who should," Abel stated.</p>

            <p>"... Me, define Louis?"</p>

            <p>"The one deeply involved with the girl's actions is not me, but you. And if the girl is to entrust her fate, she would hope for you, not me."</p>

            <p>Feeling the thirst in his throat, Subaru stood beside Abel who spoke with detachment, shifting his gaze from Subaru to Ubilk, "There was no mistake in what you heard from the stars, right? That the key to counter the 'Great Disaster' is the girl this bastard brought along."</p>

            <p>Ubilk shrugged his shoulders, causing his chains to jingle, "Yes, my story hasn't changed. I don't know what the stars have recognized in that child, just as with the first Groovy."</p>

            <p>Replanting the same seeds of worry, nobody knew how they would sprout, what buds they would bear, what flowers they would bloom. Nevertheless, Subaru keenly felt that he could not continue to carry these seeds, neither ensuring they bloomed nor withered.</p>

            <p>The emperor, oblivious to other's pain, thus informed Subaru, suffering from this harsh reality, with no shred of mercy; "Hurry to reach a conclusion. If the taste of those Rins and your bravado were not lies."</p>

            <p>△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>"Subaru, did you get the answers you were looking for?"</p>

            <p>Just as he left Ubilk's prison cell, he was met with a worried Emilia. Apparently, the existence of a "Stargazer" was classified information in the Volachian Empire, so anyone other than Subaru from the kingdom was not permitted to accompany him into the room.</p>

            <p>Subaru had already been acquainted with Ubilk and Abel decided that he should indeed hear the "Stargazer's" story - that was his judgement.</p>

            <p>When asked, Subaru nervously replied "I did, but also I didn't..."</p>

            <p>"A vague answer. So, was it just a waste of time?"</p>

            <p>"I don't think so..."</p>

            <p>Beatrice approached him with a clipped stride and clasped his hand, her brows furrowing at Subaru's indecision. But she, Emilia, Otto, Garfiel, no one present rushed Subaru. While feeling a vague sense this was different from how the empire's people would have acted, he wanted to rely on their warm and nostalgic consideration.</p>

            <p>But -</p>

            <p>"I can't stay like this."</p>

            <p>He could no longer turn away. Above dishonesty, the situation had become urgent. Most of all, when he left his supportive companions, it won't be Subaru who'll suffer the most.</p>

            <p>"Therefore," Subaru said, "There's something we all need to discuss for the sake of the empire."</p>

            <p>"Something we all need to discuss?" Emilia echoed back.</p>

            <p>"Yes," Subaru nodded at Emilia's repetition, inhaling deeply. There was an inevitable and unavoidable topic that not only everyone here, but also those who are dear to Subaru who were not present, must confront.</p>

            <p>And that was —</p>

            <p>" — Let's talk explicitly about the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony, Louis Arneb."</p>
