        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>Concurrently, when Natsuki Subaru's cheek was swollen from Petra Leyte's slap and Medium O'Connell had gone into a frenzy due to Flop O'Connell's bombshell revelation.</p>

            <p>"Seems like they couldn't wait for us to arrive after all," lazily muttered the greatest shinobi of the city-state, his face tilted upward, a pipe held in his teeth. Lax shoulders slumping further, the wolf-man — Halibel, was situated amidst the flowing city lights, monitoring the quiet evening from atop the roof of the dragon carriages. They had just been targeted in a previous attack on the dragon carriages itself. Although they managed to escape trouble thanks to the children who noticed the ambush ahead of Halibel, such luck doesn't always occur. Preventing such incidents is Halibel's job.</p>

            <p>"Afterwards, that stout lad was throwing some pretty stern glances. Seems like I have to make amends," he continued. The girl he'd known from long ago through his relatives had paid a hefty price for this journey to the Empire: Halibel's accompaniment and acquiring the role of a representative from the city-state. Yet contrary to expectations that this opportunity must have sparked ample business prospects, her objective turned out to be the search for her disappeared friend. She’s a girl who doesn't like showing her weaknesses, so of course, she would never voice this out loud.</p>

            <p>"And so, guess I, an old man she's known for ages, have to lend her a hand," declaring so, Halibel slowly stood up. The connected dragon carriages, pulled by a host of earth dragons at once, were a sight demonstrating their wind-shielding protection —a starkly adventurous and greedy technology that befits the Empire. Despite this, Halibel was not accustomed to its oddity. The scenery streaming past, roads bumping under the wagon wheels and yet, no sensation of wind, no feeling of sway. In Kararagi, where earth dragons are rare and animal-pulled vehicles are more common, he had become accustomed to slow, shaky rides.</p>

            <p>Speaking of unfamiliar abnormalities, "Zombie beasts were one thing... but who'd have thought flying dragons could turn into zombies too," Halibel muttered lazily as his fingers rasped over his unmindful belly. What reflected in his narrowed eyes scanning the night sky, was a grievous crack that ran through the once-magnificent body and spread wings of the undead flying dragon, or rather a horde of "zombie dragons". A thick flock as substantial as a black cloud covering stars, was slowly approaching the dragon carriage.</p>

            <p>"What a hassle, we've got one incoming," Halibel noted, sensing the presence embedded within the approaching zombie dragon group.</p>

            <p>Sensing the ominous presence of their adversaries, a hint of disarray began creeping into the Earth Dragons pulling the carriage. Even the Earth Dragons, known as faithful allies of humans, didn't lose their wildness despite being domesticated. They felt a sense of danger towards an imminent threat, with fear residing in their hearts too. The invention of the sequential dragon carriage is indeed splendid, but such crisis is always present. To start with, the Earth Dragons are highly empathic creatures. If one becomes frightful, the fear quickly spreads...</p>

            <p>"---!!"</p>

            <p>Just as Haribel feared, a shriek that seemed to tear the twilight echoed around.</p>

            <p>It was not – a fatal voice inducing fear in the Earth Dragons for the approaching threat.</p>

            <p>The source of the scream was a shiny black Earth Dragon in the leading carriage, running its most crucial role in the line of several Earth Dragons arranged to pull the sequential dragon carriage.</p>

            <p>"Well, what a spirited boy we got here."</p>

            <p>Due to the quick wit of the shrieking black Earth Dragon, the spread of fear among the Earth Dragons was suppressed. Thanks to that, the worst case scenario of terrified Earth Dragons abandoning their roles and the sequential dragon carriage disassembling in mid-air was avoided. As Halibel was appreciating this, he suddenly realised.</p>

            <p>"Wait, it's a female, this black Earth Dragon. It's not courage but some fine maiden spirit."</p>

            <p>Narrowing his eyes, Halibel laughed a small laugh, remarking the amusing fact as he jumps into the void beyond the moving dragon carriage, springing into the sky.</p>

            <p>To intercept. To keep at bay a formidable opponent, even acknowledged as trouble by "Praise-Seekers".</p>

            <p>That formidable opponent is ---,</p>

            <p style="text-align: center">△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>"Whoa, whoa, whoa, what is that!?"</p>

            <p>Subaru's voice turned high as he stuck to the window frame of the corridor, his eyes directed at the sight outside. It was right after the meeting with Rem and Louis —in this case, Spica —in the guest room. He had just finished informing Emilia and others—who had been anxiously waiting—about the discussion and had been slapped by Petra.</p>

            <p>"This one's from me, and a bit from Otto-san too!"</p>

            <p>After receiving this physical punishment, he chewed over the worry he had caused them and the unease he will likely keep causing them. He was getting himself ready to stand on his own feet when a sudden roar broke the night sky, prompting Subaru and others to press against the window.</p>

            <p>"That’s a black flying dragon... No, it's far larger than just a flying dragon!"</p>

            <p>"That size... it's not that of a huge wyvern. Undoubtedly, it's dragon class. And also..."</p>

            <p>"―― That dragon, it has three heads!"</p>

            <p>Sure enough, as Emilia, clinging to the window above Subaru and Beatrice, shouted, the frightening sight was recognised as monstrous not just by Subaru, but also by the others in the alternate world.</p>

            <p>A gigantic black dragon was flying through the night sky alongside their carriage, its colossal body and three heads fiercely swinging about.</p>

            <p>Its robust body and expansive wings were cracked, and the three pairs of golden eyes that asserted their existence in the night sky confirmed its true identity.</p>

            <p>"A Dragon Zombie...!!"</p>

            <p>"A black dragon with three heads... Could it be the "Three-headed" Valgren?"</p>

            <p>"Do you know it, sister?"</p>

            <p>While still resting their cheeks on the window glass, the three of them turned back to Ram. Holding her own elbow, Ram glared at the dragon outside with soft red eyes and said,</p>

            <p>"It was an infamous evil dragon that once wreaked havoc in a city on the boundary between the empire and the kingdom."</p>

            <p>"So it's just as suspected! Monsters with such mischievous nicknames are tough to handle.... it's an unwritten rule..."</p>

            <p>"It's the dragon that turned a commercial city into a wasteland a few years after the "Demi-human War". Also..."</p>

            <p>"Also, what? Is there something else?"</p>

            <p>"— The great-grandmother of the previous head, Roswaal, fell in this battle."</p>

            <p>After a moment's hesitation, Ram's words silenced Subaru and the others. Learning that a close family member was a victim heightens the perceived threat of the enemy. Especially when that family member is Roswaal's grandmother. One can't assume her to be weak.</p>

            <p>Currently, Halibel seems to be handling the formidable evil dragon, but...</p>

            <p>"Um, can you explain who those werewolves are?"</p>

            <p>Tanza, who was peeking into the same window with Subaru, was unable to hide her surprise at the ongoing battle she saw outside.</p>

            <p>Her expression of shock was not misplaced.</p>

            <p>The image of Halibel fighting, as she described it as "those werewolves", was accurate.</p>

            <p>Because,</p>

            <p>"There seems to be... about three Halibels..."</p>

            <p>"No, Subaru, there's four. One of them seems to be trying to cut off the dragon's wings from its back."</p>

            <p>"In this case, I don't think it's a matter of the exact number..."</p>

            <p>Hailed as the strongest shinobi in the city-state, Halibel effortlessly deflected a lethal attack from Sphinx. Just that feat alone was more than enough to bolster his reputation. Yet the battle unfolding before Subaru and his friends showcased a level of combat befitting of that honor.</p>

            <p>It was nothing extraordinary. Halibel was fighting in the sky against a wicked dragon using his shinobi tactic of creating duplicates of himself. Pair that with his high-speed combat skills and it's no wonder Tanza, who's unfamiliar with Halibel, had misconstrued that the strongest individual in the city-state was actually a group of shinobi known as the "Devotees."</p>

            <p>Regardless—</p>

            <p>"Uwaau!"</p>

            <p>"I think it's not just the wicked dragon we need to worry about. Shouldn't we all regroup?"</p>

            <p>Spica cried out in surprise as Rem, who held her hand, suggested that they regroup. Ideally, they would have liked to discuss how to handle Spica in a more settled environment, but they had no choice but to adapt to their evolving situation.</p>

            <p>"That would be the best course... Let's go join the rest now. Abel and the others should be on the move too. Just a little longer—Gahh!"</p>

            <p>"Subaru!?"</p>

            <p>Trying to follow Rem's proposal and planning to move, Subaru stopped speaking halfway due to a sudden, searing pain in his chest. Emilia had to support Subaru, who tried to crouch down from the pain.</p>

            <p>But Subaru wasn't the only one experiencing this anomaly.</p>

            <p>"Are you alright?"</p>

            <p>"Being held up by you...how humiliating, deer girl..."</p>

            <p>"Even Beatrice... Barusu, what's going on?"</p>

            <p>Just like Subaru, Beatrice staggered from sudden pain, expressing her discontent at being supported by the ever-ready Tanza. Ram questioned this exchange with Subaru, to which he replied, "I-I don’t know…"</p>

            <p>"Suddenly, my chest just started to hurt...Ugh?!"</p>

            <p>As he said this, Subaru looked down and lowered the neck of his shirt, his eyes widening. Spotting the same thing on Subaru, Emilia and Ram frowned in bewilderment.</p>

            <p>What they saw was a scar looking like a red leech bite, but it wasn’t just any scar.</p>

            <p>"What is this...a shape of someone’s eye?"</p>

            <p>"Oh, so it looks like that to you too? It’s a mark of an eyeball, but wait, Beatrice! Do you have…"</p>

            <p>"Beatrice has the same mark on her soft skin."</p>

            <p>At Subaru's chest was a mark about the same size as his now child sized hand, - a pattern that looked like a deformed eye. The same symbol seemed to be inscribed on Beatrice as well, as Tanza peered into the collar of her flared dress and nodded deeply.</p>

            <p>"But, only me and Beatrice? Is everyone else okay?"</p>

            <p>"You dirty-minded."</p>

            <p>"It's pure concern! Who’d say indecent things in this state and at this size!?"</p>

            <p>Subaru grimaced as he soothed with his hand the mark still throbbing with pain, confirming that none of his comrades had it. It was a ominous sign, given the situation. Naturally, it could be the action of whoever was hostile to them, but the intention was unclear. Alternatively, Subaru and Beatrice could be connected by a covenant, which allowed a phenomenon cast on one to appear on the other.</p>

            <p>"I'm stuck. Best to get someone knowledgeable to look at this. For now, we need to get out of here..."</p>

            <p>"Ah! Watch out!"</p>

            <p>"――Don't!"</p>

            <p>Trying to propose a departure from the scene again, they were interrupted once more.
            Subaru, along with Spica and Rem, pushed everyone away all at once looking shocked. An impromptu action, yet the right one.</p>

            <p>――Because the giant pincer of the enemy shadow that broke through the roof directly above them, violently tore through where they had been standing.</p>

            <p>“Lord Roswaal!”</p>

            <p>“Master!”</p>

            <p>With these simultaneous cries of concern, Roswaal managed a bitter smile. Despite their reservations about trusting Roswaal, there was no doubt about their genuine concern. It affirmed that they, too, were part of Emilia's camp; the innate goodness of these two who refused to be swayed by him.</p>

            <p>"…… Ah, a mark."</p>

            <p>Swallowing his bitter smile, Roswaal opened the front of his clothes. Upon inspecting the pain-ridden area, a red, swollen wound emerged with a pattern resembling an eye. Petra's eyes, hidden beneath her veil, wavered in surprise upon Roswaal's sudden display of his chest.
            Seeing that mark, Otto furrows his brows, "That is..."</p>

            <p>"Count, did you say a mark? I'm afraid to even think..."</p>

            <p>"That worry is spot on. This is presumably a proof of enmity or a sign that you have been targeted. Either way, it's nothing to be pleased about."</p>

            <p>"An enemy or target, you say?"</p>

            <p>Catching a brief sidelong glance from Otto, Petra immediately understands its intent and vigorously shakes her head. Neither Otto nor Petra bear this mark - a fact that should bring relief but...</p>

            <p>"What kind of effect does that mark have?"</p>

            <p>"...There are a few possibilities. It could slowly but surely erode life... or read your thoughts. Or it could continually pinpoint your location."</p>

            <p>"I see, you're making a point to list the bad possibilities first. So, the most likely is a mark for locating the whereabouts, right?"</p>

            <p>"Exactly, you two are truly sharp-minded."</p>

            <p>As Roswaal closed his eyes, Otto and Petra evaluated the listed possibilities calmly. They were right in their judgement. The most dangerous kind of curse, which erodes life, would not be doable from afar and thus, can be ruled out. However, having a mark that pinpoints one's location could still present a significant problem.</p>

            <p>"We might need to consider acting separately more to not let our actions be public knowledge. There's also the external support of Halibel. You two should separate from me..."</p>

            <p>"No, it seems it's already too late."</p>

            <p>With those words spoken in a low voice, Otto reaches out and pulls Petra close. Petra, wide-eyed with surprise, is suddenly met by a large object crashing through the window and landing in their car.</p>

            <p>This enemy exuding a dangerous aura was dressed in black armor, a large pair of pincers in its hand - a Corpse Soldier.</p>

            <p>"P-Petra!" she stifles a scream and points at the enemy from within Otto's arms. Praising the bravery of the young girl who tries to take the first move in their sudden predicament, Roswaal steps forward and strikes the enemy before it can swing its pincers.</p>

            <p>He thrusts his hand into the gap in the helmet, jams his fingers into the enemy's eye sockets, and chants,</p>

            <p>"Goa!"</p>

            <p>In an instant, the enemy's head explodes into a fireball from within, bursting open along with the armor.
            Contrary to his flashy entrance, Roswaal plans to not let the enemy who's jumped in to do anything. Thinking he has played his best move, he looks back, only to realize he was naive. One after another, soldiers in the same equipment pour onto the dragon carriage, from its roof and its corridor. Just like that, the dragon carriage itself has turned into a moving battlefield.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center">△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>"Abel, over here, hurry! An-chan, run too!" Medium cries out, taking on the rearmost position, and repels the enemy attack with her twin swords as she exclaims.</p>

            <p>"My dear sister, believe it or not, I'm already running at my full speed!" Flop replies wearily.</p>

            <p>With the violent clashing of barbarian blades and large claws, the two men - Vincent and Flop - had been enduring the enemy onslaught, shielded by Medium as they slipped through any gaps that appeared. At a glance, their state was pitiful, but there was more to it than their being injured and non-combatants.</p>

            <p>"Emperor Vincent, sir, are you alright? Don't say they've poisoned you please! We can't afford for you not to keep your promise!" Flop mumbles as he supports Vincent.</p>

            <p>".....Humph. Try to conceal your ambitions sometimes, it would be less rude," admonishes Vincent.</p>

            <p>"Emperor Vincent, you may surround yourself with ambitious people, but there are those in the world who get close to you for reasons other than ambition!"</p>

            <p>Vincent, propping up on Flop, snorts scoffing at his absurd statements. His expression is briefly contorted as a sharp pain pierces his chest. The sudden onset of pain and red scars were gnawing away at Vincent like a thorn, flooding his body.</p>

            <p>With an attack from an enemy that Medium had been holding back coming immediately after, Vincent was convinced he was under the same kind of troublesome attack as before, perhaps even worse.</p>

            <p>"Is that pain in your chest because of..."</p>

            <p>"The annoying Evil Eye power of my brother Palladio Manesque, no doubt. The bastard, after losing his life in the 'Imperial Selection', had apparently improved his ability."</p>

            <p>"Evil Eye…! What's its effect?"</p>

            <p>"His ability was merely to deliver his voice to known locations. But it seems he has improved its accuracy after his death."</p>

            <p>At Flop's question, Vincent reminisces about the brother he once killed. Palladio was a formidable contender among his brothers vying for the throne, but his downfall was due to his complacency with the power of his mageyes and his failure to fully exploit their capabilities.
            He never could've imagined there'd be a chance to rectify it after death—.</p>

            <p>"...No, it's not like he could change himself simply by dying. Someone must've ordered Palladio for this to happen."</p>

            <p>"But your siblings might command Palladio too, since if he's a royal, right? Even considering he's become an undead, making such a person yield is...”</p>

            <p>"---Generally, I have an inclination. If Palladio were to submit, it would be either to the previous emperor Drizen Vollachia, or someone he himself could recognize as superior."</p>

            <p>There was no one more suitable to meet these conditions than Vincent himself yet, given that the opponent is consorting with the undead, Vincent himself was the first to be ruled out.</p>

            <p>The previous emperor, who was also Vincent’s father Drizen, surfaced as a notable candidate for the true ruler of the undead. In consideration of this worthless factor, he also had the fleeting thought of his long-lost younger sister.</p>

            <p>However, considering who Medium was opposing, there was essentially only one possible enemy---.</p>

            <p>"--- Lamia."</p>

            <p>Fulfilling the conditions to command Palladio, there was no one else, aside from Lamia Godwin, who was a vicious soldier carrying a large pair of shears and leading the "Pruning Squad".</p>

            <p>In the "Selection Ceremony" vying for the Imperial throne, he had surmised a virtual enemy in one of the three siblings whom Vincent had highly regarded, and held his chest where his pain was emanating from.</p>

            <p>Just when—,</p>

            <p>"They’re a real pain in the ass, these dead bastards!!”</p>

            <p>A rough voice roars out and white blades whirled wildly ahead in the path of Vincent and the rest.</p>

            <p>Upon looking, the undead who crashed through the windows were being cut down and reduced to dust by the soldier coming from the opposite side of Vincent and the team, a one-eyed man with curly hair.</p>

            <p>The soldier, huffing aggressively, realizing Vincent and his team, said,</p>

            <p>"Hey! You lot, lend a hand! My sister's fainting in there..."</p>

            <p>"No, you ought to lend a hand."</p>

            <p>"Wha-? What're you say— Wha-, are you Emperor?!"</p>

            <p>The man who had been approaching with a rude tone, realized Vincent's true identity and screamed.</p>

            <p>And as he responded to the man appropriately for his disrespectful advance, Vincent flicked his chin towards his back.</p>

            <p>"Work alongside the ones at the back and halt the enemy’s advance. I will take care of your sister."</p>

            <p>"I-I understand! Private first-class Jamal O'Reilly understands!"</p>

            <p>"Gather your strength, Jamal O'Reilly. The life and death of the Empire hinges on your effort," Vincent declared, causing Jamal, the one-eyed man, to tremble visibly. In response, Jamal let out a roar powerful like a wild beast and began to push back the undead, leaping over the heads of Vincent and Flop to join the struggling Medium at the back.</p>

            <p>"My eyepatch wearing friend! Be respectful to Medium since she’s a potential candidate for the Empress!"</p>

            <p>"But I haven’t said yes yet~!" Medium chimed in rather nonchalantly to Flop's words.
            
            Meanwhile, Flop dashed into the room where Jamal's sister was holed up. There, he found a woman in a wheelchair whose eyes were wide with surprise. Still clinging onto her wheelchair, the lady's eyes welled up with pain-filled tears as she croaked, "Wh-what's happened? Why... why don't you just leave me alone...?"</p>

            <p>"...... That's probably what everyone is thinking about the state of the Empire right now." While agreeing wholeheartedly with the despaired woman's voice, Vincent shook his head disapprovingly. No matter how bad the situation gets, they cannot afford to stop the dragon carriage. If they would stop once, how long it would take for the carriage to start moving again? And if that happens...</p>

            <p>"Every moment counts. We must reach the fortress city," he said resolutely.</p>

            <p>△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>"If we stop our dragon carriage now, we'll be surrounded by more enemies. The design of the dragon carriage assumed the use of a wind-breaking blessing. If it starts running without it, it surely won't escape capsizing," said a voice, revealing the fatal flaw of the dragon carriage, to the brewing idea of halting the dragon carriage amidst the attack they were facing.</p>

            <p>Anastasia, hearing this, recognized that stopping was not realistic.</p>

            <p>"Besides, the land dragon has been running for almost half a day... If it stops now, we won't be able to start again tonight for sure."</p>

            <p>"There is also the numerical disadvantage against the enemy. The mobility of the dragon carriage is the only thing making up for this gap. If we lose this edge, our fate would certainly be the same as that of the frail elderly prime minister Berstetz," mused Selena.</p>

            <p>"Screw this talk! Stop leaving me in the dark with just words!"</p>

            <p>"The Duke of Dracoy is a woman of such nature and after this 'Great Disaster' issue is resolved, it would be only natural for me to face execution..." Berstetz admitted.</p>

            <p>"Damn it, don’t just accept your fate like that!"</p>

            <p>As Selena casually but ambiguously uttered those words, Berstetz responded in kind, with not an ounce of lightness in his tone. This exchange led to Garfiel raising his voice. The attack of the new enemies began when Anastasia and Garfiel were in the same room. Ideally, Garfiel would have loved to join up with Emilia's team, but…</p>

            <p>"I'm sorry for the trouble, Garf. But thanks to you, we were all able to hang onto our lives, weren't we?"</p>

            <p>"Tsch... The commanding officers, Ram and Lady Emilia, I'm not worried about them. But I am worried about Otto-nii…"</p>

            <p>"There is no need to worry. Otto-kun is a merchant; he knows how to handle things properly. But still…"</p>

            <p>With a frustrated grinding of his teeth, Garfiel – his impressive arm not looking so sturdy right now – prepared himself for the large shears-wielding hunting soldier who was boarding the vehicle.</p>

            <p>Punching them, knocking them flying, pulverizing them in one fell swoop, Garfiel was ready to face them down. As the soldiers were defeated and their bodies turned to dust, Berstetz, grouped at the far end with Anastasia as non-combatants, narrowed his eyes further,</p>

            <p>"The 'Pruning Squad'... seems like Lady Lamia is here."</p>

            <p>"Lady Lamia Godwin, huh? I wanted to see her at least once."</p>

            <p>"Really? What kind of person is she?"</p>

            <p>"Perhaps the prime minister knows better. After all, it was he who once proclaimed her worth of being an emperor."</p>

            <p>As Anastasia's gaze turned to Berstetz, Selena, who held her sword at the ready as well, shrugged her shoulders. The elderly man who didn't refute Selena's statement nodded with unreadable squinted eyes,</p>

            <p>"Lady Lamia Godwin, she was a woman worthy of the Vollachian Empire's throne. If it weren't for Vincent Abellux and Prisca Benedict in the same era, she would likely have been the emperor."</p>

            <p>"So, has she returned from the dead as a corpse to fulfill some sort of ambition? Prime Minister, if you swear loyalty again, you might be spared?"</p>

            <p>"Sadly, both Lady Lamia and I are losers. That goes against the imperial flow."</p>

            <p>In response to Berstetz's slow shake of his head, Selena squinted one eye, and sighed.</p>

            <p>It appears that Berstetz's solemn answer had failed to please Selena. Anastasia could discern their once complex relationship as master and servant, but it seemed nothing more than that.</p>

            <p>"――Anastasia."</p>

            <p>Suddenly, a voice called out near Anastasia's ear as she was lost in thought, prompting her to lift her head. The source of call was from Echidna, who was dressed as a fox collar around Anastasia's neck. When she glanced at her, Echidna's black eyes were directed at the entrance to the passenger cabin.</p>

            <p>"――Lady Anastasia, he has returned."</p>

            <p>Following Echidna's line of sight, the one who appeared from beyond the door was Julius. The chiseled-faced Julius gripped a knight's sword in one hand and carried a slender man in the other arm―the one whom Julius had been tasked to fetch.</p>

            <p>Brushing his ash-grey long hair, that man lifted up his pitiful face, saying,</p>

            <p>"Really now, everything is so sudden, it flusters me. My chest is hot and painful, and I have been swung all around by this swordsman, it's terrible."</p>

            <p>"Don't complain so much. Shouldn't you be grateful to me and my knight? Their target might be you."</p>

            <p>"What!?"</p>

            <p>The one who widened his eyes in surprise was Ubilk the "Stargazer", who had been detained in the rear wagon. Apparently a prized asset within the empire, he is an indispensable source of information in the empire's fight against the "Great Disaster". Julius had been dispatched to prevent his assassination.</p>

            <p>"Garf would likely take the scenic route and get distracted by other things."</p>

            <p>"I'm properly fighting ya know! Don’t you start complainin’!"</p>

            <p>"Oh really? If I hadn't asked you for this job, wouldn't you be out, helping that giant snake outside?"</p>

            <p>"Growl... "</p>

            <p>Garfiel grumbled, his face a spitting image of someone whose true nature had been spotted, his fangs quivering. One by one, the chain of dragon carriages was exposed to the enemies attacks. However, the biggest threat was being handled by Halibel, who was holding down the evil dragon alone. He had prevented it from approaching here.</p>

            <p>There is an intense roar from the dragon and the accompanying thunder-like noise cleaves the air. It would be impossible to stall the world's most hardy creature, let alone a city-state's strongest, if it weren't for Halibel.</p>

            <p>"Garfiel, I am grateful for your protection of Lady Anastasia and the others. I respect your bravery."</p>

            <p>"Shut up! Just like the captain, I'm not good with flatteries!"</p>

            <p>"That's too bad. Like with Subaru, I wish to become friends with you as well."</p>

            <p>"Rawrrrr!!"</p>

            <p>In response to Julius' words from the front, Garfiel roared mightily and thrust out his fist. It crossed with Julius', a coordinated move to smash through the undead that appeared behind them. Despite Garfiel's refusal to acknowledge it, their rhythms matched perfectly, as befitting top-class warriors. "But, if we just keep this up, this is just a temporary fix... We stopped the Undead Express, but if it stops completely - it's game over. We've got to change the situation somehow, yeah?"</p>

            <p style="text-align: center">△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>"Uuuuuuugh!!" A deep, sturdy voice rang out as the golden hammer spear was swung. The sideways attack swept away the thickly armored undead in groups, spurting them from atop the carriage before they hit the ground; they splintered into dust. However, even with multiple foes dispatched at once, their numbers did not diminish.</p>

            <p>"Fool! You cunning pests!!" Goz Ralfon roared like a lion, his grave face covered in scars and beard inflamed with anger. From Goz's field of vision, a swarm of undead flying dragons filled the sky, their claws clutching undead being successively dropped into the Undead Express. This audacious transport method was the worst mechanism by which enemy soldiers could invade.</p>

            <p>- Not all the airborne enemy soldiers were latching onto the Undead Express.</p>

            <p>Rather, nearly half were simply hurled from the undead flying dragons, dropping to the ground, their resurrected bodies turning into dust from the impact. This reckless deployment that would be suicidal for living soldiers instead became an efficient transport method for the dead, unafraid of losses. And that was made possible by――</p>

            <p>"The Lamia General's 'Pruning Squad'!" At the leading carriage of the Undead Express, at the most crucial position protecting the ground dragons, Goz glared at the sky, the worst assortment of undead brought by the dead dragon flock.</p>

            <p>The 'Pruning Squad' was a group of malevolent soldiers engaged in the massive purge passed down in the Vollachian Empire. All members were clad in armor obscuring the shape of their faces, wielding enormous pruning shears in hand, pruning inconvenient humanity for the sake of their master's dominion ――hence the name Pruning Troop.</p>

            <p>The reason why this group had left its name in the imperial history was because of a royal child of the empire— Lamia Godwin, who was only nine years old at the time, had annihilated the entire force of an intermediate level nobleman who had risen in rebellion.
            
            The victims of the purge went through horrific experiences that tasted like hell on earth.</p>

            <p>Naturally, the princess, still a child, made all her subordinates execute these gruesome deeds, resulting in a formidable troop displaying unparalleled loyalty. The extent to which she held sway over the hearts of her soldiers was demonstrated by this military tactic. ——Even in death, the essence of Lamia's poison that had eaten into their souls remained unextracted.</p>

            <p>And then,</p>

            <p>"——Oh my. I'm glad you still remember me and my adorable beasts, considering how many years have passed since then."</p>

            <p>A chilling dread split the air followed by a saccharine voice pouring down from above.
            
            At that very moment, Goz recklessly swung up his hammer-spear, bouncing back the blazing red trajectory with force and leaping backwards. Immediately after, the hammer-spear in Goz's hand ignited.
            
            It was only natural.— The brilliance of the "Yang Sword" could illuminate anything and everything dazzlingly.</p>

            <p>"I can't believe you've come down to the battlefield yourself...Lady Lamia Godwin!!"</p>

            <p>"Is it that much of a surprise? With this body, that's the best thing to do, right?"</p>

            <p>Goz, gritting his teeth, stared straight ahead, where a regally undead woman stood enchanting with a sinister smile.
            
            A luxurious dress as red as blood, countless brightly-colored pieces of jewelry complemented her natural beauty that was characteristic of the Vollachian Royal family, although it was insignificant compared to her pale, crackled skin and eerie golden eyes.</p>

            <p>Once upon a time, "Poison Princess" Lamia Godwin, who might have been in the position of Empress, had contested against Vincent Vollachia for the throne in the "Emperor's Ritual" —— as if to prove how she had been completely changed, she looked down at her shattered half-body which had been so due to Goz's counter-attack.</p>

            <p>However, even after taking a heavy blow that would have reduced any other undead to dust, Lamia's body didn't head towards collapse, instead repairing its cracks, reverting to its original form.</p>

            <p>"Your body is..."</p>

            <p>"It seems that it's not as convenient as boasting about this immortal body that doesn't disappear no matter how crushed or broken it is, huh?"</p>

            <p>Stroking, calmly, her restored part, as a proof of recovery, Lamia carried the "Yang Sword" with the healed hand. The undiminished brilliance of the sword in her arm seemed almost sacrilegious.</p>

            <p>Disturbed by this fact, Goz made a scowling face, to which Lamia muttered, "That's unpleasant".</p>

            <p>"In the Crystal Palace, we were unable to have a calm conversation. Can't you stop making such a scary face, Second General Ralfon?"</p>

            <p>"Guh…"</p>

            <p>"Oh, you're now the First General, aren't you? I've heard. Your brother Vincent has revived the "Nine Divine Generals" system, hasn't he? That’s just like him," she said, the hand not holding the "Yang Sword" resting on her chin, as Lamia grinned at her own joke.</p>

            <p>Her mannerisms and words unmistakably belonged to the Lamia Goz had known in life, causing him to experience revulsion and anger at this resurrection technique that mimicked her previous behavior.</p>

            <p>Unperturbed by Goz's reactions, Lamia examined Goz's golden armor from top to bottom, commenting, "The 'Nine Divine Generals' system is just a mechanism to rise using power as the only measure. It's the perfect method to gather easy to control pawns who lack brains."</p>

            <p>"… Indeed, behind reviving the 'Nine Divine Generals', there would have been a plan to prepare a countermeasure against this 'Great Calamity' you mentioned. I accept that."</p>

            <p>"So, it sounds like there's a disagreement?"</p>

            <p>"With the greatest respect!," he rebutted.</p>

            <p>Lamia's comments had an undertone of praising Vincent's thinking. Before opposing him at the "Emperor Selection Ceremony," Lamia had been quite fond of Vincent, they say. Death separated their paths, but the trust was not lost, even in death.</p>

            <p>"But…" Goz hesitated, "Lady Lamia, to what extent do you know what has happened while you were not alive?"</p>

            <p>"That's a strange question. Unfortunately, I remember nothing of the time I was dead. I'm in the middle of relearning everything. You're welcome to teach me."</p>

            <p>"In that case, allow me to correct you! I acknowledge this may be rude, but!" Goz's voice grew stern.</p>

            <p>"Silent…"</p>

            <p>"Madam Lamia, as per your speculation, the current 'Nine Divine Generals' are indeed formidable talents. All of them far exceed someone like me... However, none of them can be reduced to mere 'easily controlled pawns'!"</p>

            <p>Covered in his golden armor, Goz puffed out his chest as he declared this with fervor.</p>

            <p>If Vincent had indeed resurrected the "Nine Divine Generals" as pawns to beckon his every command in preparation for the "Great Disaster", it could be said his plan backfired. Each and every general was a hardened rogue, far from being agreeable.</p>

            <p>"Dear Lady Lamia, the splendor of the Empire is not solely embodied in you!"</p>

            <p>"......Are you, by any chance, insulting dear Brother Vincent?"</p>

            <p>"No! No, Your Excellency Lamia!"</p>

            <p>At Lamia's words, marked with a narrowing of her eyes and a threatening undertone, Goz shook his head. The notion toward Vincent seemed to stir anger in Lamia, but Goz, too, was particular about showing respect and refraining from being disrespectful to the Emperor. However, there had been a slight shift since the decision to abandon the Imperial capital. All due to the changes within Vincent rather than Goz.</p>

            <p>"He relied upon your service."</p>

            <p>"What did you say?”</p>

            <p>"Lady Lamia, the Vincent Vollachia that you know was indeed commendable! However, even now, the Emperor is changing in pursuit of further greatness!"</p>

            <p>"......"</p>

            <p>"The Vollachian Empire will continue to advance! In order to achieve this, we cannot ignore those who cling onto the past, especially if they were once dead!!"</p>

            <p>In their shared desire for the Emperor to be flawless, Goz and Lamia were much alike. But what drastically differed between the two was whether they were acquainted with the passage of nine years. The immutable fact being, those who halt the march of time will be left behind by those who stride forward.</p>

            <p>"Those who stride forth undeterred surpass even the expectations and anticipations of those who have halted. That's the Emperor of our Vollachian Empire, standing at its very apex!"</p>

            <p>With a raised hammer spear, blazing at the tip, Goz overcame his hesitation and charged forward. Up until that moment, his respect for Lamia, a fellow member of the Vollachian royal family, had restrained him, even as she bore an altered appearance. But now, his chains were torn asunder by an even stronger, fervent loyalty.</p>

            <p>"Raaaaahhhh--!!"</p>

            <p>Goz's battle cry echoed as he swooped down on Lamia, carving a semi-circle in the air. Not even one of the "Nine Divine Generals" could easily stop the full-force blow from Goz, renowned for his unmatched strength. Especially not against a woman's slender arm, despite wielding the "Yang Sword".</p>

            <p>In fact, Lamia did not attempt to block Goz's strike with the "Sun Sword" she held in her hand.</p>

            <p>"Not bad for a simple-minded man, General Ralfon —you really do talk quite a bit," she declared with a thin smile. "I was quite impressed, so I'll give you a little advice."</p>

            <p>Her pale lips mapped these words as she gazed at Goz with a seductive smirk.</p>

            <p>At that moment, straight into the incoming spearhead of his descending hammer-spears, she shattered like pottery without any resistance, and was blown into smithereens.</p>

            <p>Her final words were about offering guidance before she was smashed beyond any hope of repair.</p>

            <p>Of course, there were also the matters of the earlier military council hearing. Even if the undead were to be defeated, the royal mages could've identified a nuclear insect and used it as a medium, bringing about the possibility of reviving them.</p>

            <p>"But even so...," Goz hesitated, confident that by slaying Lamia here, the tide of the situation would shift.</p>

            <p>If the "Pruning Squad" lost a person who openly gave instructions, the existence—or rather, their capability as a commander, could give them an advantage. Goz believed that —until Lamia interrupted him,</p>

            <p>"Are you listening, General Ralfon?"</p>

            <p>"What!?"</p>

            <p>Once again, her saccharine voice grazed his ears. Goz's spear was swung to the rear, smashing the mid-air silhouette of an enemy, severing his body top and bottom with a sound like shattering ceramics.</p>

            <p>Goz took a breath as he watched the shattered, flying bodies.</p>

            <p>The face of the person he'd reflexively attacked and reduced to dust was impossible —it was the person who he should've just slain himself.</p>

            <p>"As you cleverly pointed out," she resumed speaking.</p>

            <p>"Impossible..." Goz muttered in disbelief.</p>

            <p>Before this unthinkable spectacle, his hand that gripped the spear shivered.</p>

            <p>Was it out of anger or another emotion? Even Goz could not determine. However, what was certain was that it was a blasphemy against the Vollachian Empire to which the "Lion Knight," Goz Ralfon pledged his loyalty.</p>

            <p>"This, is a war of extermination between us, who have been left in the past, and you," multiple Lamia Goodwins echoed as they stared back at him, broken and smiling, each of them clutching countless "Yang Swords."</p>
