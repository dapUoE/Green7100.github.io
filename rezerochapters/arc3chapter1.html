            <p>"Over here, this way! Hurry or we'll be caught!"</p>

            <p>"I get it, I get it! Just wait..."</p>

            <p>His arm is pulled and he runs through the rough terrain.</p>

            <p>A narrow alleyway. Despite it being mid-day, sunlight does not reach here. The dimly-lit alleyway forms a complex maze, seemingly rejecting the two figures trying to seek refuge.</p>

            <p>To Subaru, who lacks understanding of this environment, this situation is far from ideal. He can only hope the person leading him knows their way around, but...</p>

            <p>"Are you picking the darkest paths on purpose? Do you even know where we are going?"</p>

            <p>"I... I don't!"</p>

            <p>Answered with such clarity that it was almost refreshing, Subaru places his hand on his forehead, feeling a sense of despair. "As I thought..." he mutters. The answer was expected. After all, the person pulling Subaru's hand was dressed in such extravagant attire unfit for this dingy alleyway.</p>

            <p>A fluttering red dress made of what appeared to be expensive material. A necklace that refracts light brilliantly. The glimpses of her skin were unblemished white, suggesting she came from a high upbringing. And above all, her bright orange hair emphasized her nobility and the lively presence that's far from being associated with slums.</p>

            <p>Upon re-evaluating her appearance, Subaru reassures himself he's gotten into another predicament. Behind them, several footsteps were closing in on them. It's not a situation where he can afford to stop and collect himself.</p>

            <p>How did things turn out like this?</p>

            <p>Gasping for breath, wincing from the pain in his lungs, Subaru's mind was filled with such questions.</p>

            <p>The incident dated back about two days from Subaru's confusion.</p>

            <p>※※　※　※　※　※　※　※　※　※　※　※　※</p>

            <p>For Natsuki Subaru, morning was a time to sleep and certainly wasn't a time for vigorous activities.</p>

            <p>Under the morning sun, he felt as if he'd melt — not quite an exaggeration, but his Natsuki Subaru DNA seemed to wither under the bright light. For such a Subaru, doing radio exercises in front of many people while soaking in the morning sun was something he couldn't have imagined even a month ago.</p>

            <p>Speaking of which, being summoned to another world was also beyond his expectations in the first place.</p>

            <p>His transformation was severe enough to make him think he must have hit his head hard. In reality, he did have memories of sustained head injuries that would reasonably cause such a change of mind, so he couldn't completely deny that aspect. Even considering those, however, the fact was he didn't find his situation all that undesirable.</p>

            <p>"Raise your arm high towards the sky for the finish -- Victory!"</p>

            <p>"Victory!!"</p>

            <p>Echoing Subaru's closing line with their hands raised, a multitude of voices followed him as they finished their radio calisthenics. Listening to the ensuing cheers, Subaru swiped away the sweat beading on his forehead and looked ahead.</p>

            <p>Before him -- encircling Subaru, were the residents of the village closest to the Roswaal Mansion. Around half of them must have gathered.</p>

            <p>He began the radio calisthenics lightheartedly, but it seemed to resonate more than expected with the inhabitants of this other world. It now stirred a considerable movement within the village, forcing Subaru, notorious for his fickle pursuits, into a position where he couldn't just quit. However,</p>

            <p>"Subaru, we're done with the exercise!" "Stamp it, stamp it!" "Yahoo! Yahoo!"</p>

            <p>"Darn it! Don't gather around so early in the morning, you're loud! You all are really energetic, it's wonderful to be young! No need to rush, the stamps won't run away! Get in line, get in line!”</p>

            <p>He responded playfully to the children who flocked around him, but Subaru's expression was etched with bitter mirth. Yet, there were no signs of him rejecting it.</p>

            <p>Following his instruction, the children lined up neatly in front of him. After seeing this Subaru nodded in satisfaction, then turned around,</p>

            <p>"Alright, Emilia-tan, please."</p>

            <p>"Sure, here you go."</p>

            <p>From behind, Emilia handed him a small bag she was holding, her lips curled into a smile that was neither bitter nor joyous.</p>

            <p>Upon opening the delivered package, what came out was a raw potato, shaved down to about the size of a pencil. The children let out excited yells upon the slender potato's debut, to which Subaru responded by raising the potato up high,</p>

            <p>"Good job! All right, let's stamp it. Show me your papers!"</p>

            <p>He dabbed the end of the potato into an ink container that was in the bag, then pressed it onto the papers extended by the lined-up children. As their papers began sporting images, the children's faces brightened with joy, prompting Emilia to say,</p>

            <p>"He shaved a flat surface on the potato to make potato stamps. Subaru really comes up with the weirdest things."</p>

            <p>"If you scrape off the ink on the surface, it becomes emergency food, and there's a surprising amount of skill in this drawing. Today's masterpiece is titled 'Monday's Puck'," Subaru explained. The image pressed onto the paper was a deformed drawing of a small cat, exuding an air of ennui. With its distinct features captured rather well, anyone who knew the model would recognize it instantly at a glance. Well, the name was directly used as the title though.</p>

            <p>"...I'm really surprised. It looks exactly like Puck. Subaru, you're good at drawing, aren't you?"</p>

            <p>"Well, I've wasted plenty of time practicing. I threw it all away halfway through, though, so I only learned the basics."</p>

            <p>Every otaku at one point tried their hand at drawing. Your artistic style will either establish itself and make you famous, or you'll abandon it depending on your motivation. Subaru was the latter.</p>

            <p>"What I can do best is etch pictures of cats into potatoes in a world that has no tradition of stamps, and then get the attention of innocent children accordingly."</p>

            <p>"That sounds somewhat unpleasant, though... And doesn't the drawing of Puck seem a little under-energetic?"</p>

            <p>"I told you, it's 'Monday's Puck'. I tried to express the gloomy feeling that another week is about to start. The points are these drooping ears."</p>

            <p>To Emilia's comment, Subaru passionately defended his ambitious work. Meanwhile, he keeps stamping the drawings onto papers handed over by eager children, amassing their pledge to participate in radio calisthenics.</p>

            <p>Subaru's playful idea was inspired by the summer vacation stamp rally. As he carves a new stamp every night before bed, many of the village children look forward to what picture they will receive.</p>

            <p>Subaru exhibited a strange knack for manual dexterity that appealed to the children.</p>

            <p>After exchanging pleasantries with the joyous children, promises were exchanged for next day's radio calisthenics before he waved goodbye. Accompanied by Emilia, he threw a few playful jibes with the adults before beginning their journey back home.</p>

            <p>Recently, Subaru has spent his early mornings in the village. Since he hasn't fully recovered yet and can't participate in the mansion's morning workload, he has decided to spend his leisure time with Emilia. He is firm about using this painful experience to his advantage and making the most out of time with Emilia.</p>

            <p>"Ah, I’m tired. I feel bad for always dragging you out early in the morning, Emilia-tan."
            
            "It's okay. Your condition still isn’t perfect, Subaru, and Ram and Rem have their duties in the mansion. Besides, I don't mind spending time like this."</p>

            <p>"You don’t mind… spending the morning with me!?"</p>

            <p>"No, silly. I mean interacting with the villagers with whom I hadn't had much contact before. I think I had sort of distanced myself in the past."</p>

            <p>Emilia playfully dismisses Subaru's puffing words, following with a shy smile. Beneath her hood, a blush crept onto her fair profile, making Subaru unawarely feel his own cheeks warm.</p>

            <p>Emilia currently wore an outfit similar to when they first met in the royal capital. Over light clothes with a short skirt, she donned a white robe embroidered with a bird-like design. The hood enveloped her beautiful silver hair. Meanwhile, standing next to her, Subaru was dressed in a cheap, dirty gray jersey— a relic from when he first arrived in this world, which had been returned to him thoroughly mended by Rem. Of course, he himself has stitched some minor parts.</p>

            <p>Comparing his and Emilia's clothes, their appearances, and their various other characteristics, a sigh was all that emerged in his mind. To be a worthy match for her, first he must cling to the bare ground he stood on.</p>

            <p>"But still…"</p>

            <p>Emilia broke the silence held by reflective Subaru. She leaned her upper body forward, hands clasped, looking up at Subaru from an angle.</p>

            <p>"You've really become quite popular in the village Subaru. Maybe even more famous than Ram and Rem, don't you think?"</p>

            <p>"Well, after all, I'm kind of a hero who saved the children! The villagers must regard me as a hero of salvation, I guess! Possibly turning into something of a legend even!"</p>

            <p>While it sounded like a joke, the work Subaru has done wouldn’t be out of place for a real hero, making the jest unconvincing. Emilia pondered over Subaru’s playful words for a moment, her finger touching her lips, her head tilted to a side.</p>

            <p>"I think hero of salvation is... not quite accurate."</p>

            <p>"Oh, so I am the talk of the town after all. …But aside from that incident in the forest, what else could it possibly be?"</p>

            <p>It's a daring rescue that's perhaps not completely worthy of unconditional praise. Subaru's expectations, however, are unexpectedly thrown off by Emilia's following words. Emilia chuckles faintly and curls her rose-pink lips before saying,</p>

            <p>"You know, the village currently regards Subaru as a hero who saved children. Still, it seems like there are stronger rumors of him being an intellectual."</p>

            <p>"Intellectual? I can't even conduct an orchestra. I have zero musical sense."</p>

            <p>He is a legendary figure who, when stepping up to serve as the large drummer in the primary school's ensemble, flawlessly followed the instruction to pretend to play. A daunting task for someone without the slightest hint of musical ability. How a part switch was never made is still a mystery.</p>

            <p>In response to such a predictably joke-like comment, Emilia, shaking her head, says, "I don't mean it like that. They mean you're a scholar. You're being touted as a foolish sage according to Mr. Muraosa."</p>

            <p>"That doesn't sound like a compliment...The image of someone who can study but is somehow still a fool. Wait, did I do something intellectual...?"</p>

            <p>"Mayonnaise."</p>

            <p>Emilia points and simply utters a single word. Subaru nods in understanding to her words. Since the recent commotion, the spread of mayonnaise has been progressing remarkably well. Due to the opinion that it was too great a thing to only be used in Roswaal's mansion (mainly Emilia's opinion), the actual product and its recipe were first distributed to the nearby village.</p>

            <p>In just a few days, it seems to have already sparked quite a reaction.</p>

            <p>As a mayonnaise lover himself, the fact that mayonnaise had made its firm first step in the world was a joyous event. Long live the mayonnaise.</p>

            <p>However,</p>

            <p>"It's great that the wonders of mayonnaise are spreading, but is my life-saving reversal rated lower than the white lovers...?"</p>

            <p>It seems that being renowned for spreading mayonnaise rather than being treated as a hero means that this is his standing in the public's eye.</p>

            <p>Feeling somewhat inconsolable, Subaru droops his shoulders in dejection. Seeing him like this, Emilia hurriedly pats his shoulder,</p>

            <p>"Ah, um, of course, everyone is grateful that you saved the children. But the truth is, Rem was the one who actually brought them back from the forest, and the rumor going around is that Roswaal was the one who settled the final incident in the bewitched woods..."</p>

            <p>Her attempt at reassurance loses steam towards the end.</p>

            <p>The pain in her consideration only emphasized the fact that Subaru couldn’t deny her words. Reflecting on his own achievements, he found himself wrapped in surprise. Even during the incident where he had returned the children, Subaru had been severely wounded from being bitten, and except for returning Rem back to sanity during the demon beast subjugation, he had left everything else to Roswaal and just slept due to exhaustion. For once, he was left shocked by his own actions.</p>

            <p>There was no denying it: "I really haven’t done anything significant!"</p>

            <p>He had just been struggling desperately. Subaru, who felt that his efforts were now being denied, ended up feeling more insignificant. Emilia, looking at Subaru, struggles to find the right words to say, stuttering phrases like "Um…" and "No, not that…" before finally settling on,</p>

            <p>“Just stop worrying about such trifling things.”</p>

            <p>"But, Emilia..." Subaru retaliated weakly, only to be cut off,</p>

            <p>"Those who understand that you have been working hard are fully aware of it. Roswaal and Ram too. Especially Rem." She declared in a teasing manner, her index finger poking Subaru’s cheek.</p>

            <p>As he looked at her with vulnerable eyes in response to the sharp sensation, Emilia muttered “Jeez” and quickly walked ahead of him. Once she reached the front, she turned to face him, her hood falling back, revealing her long silver hair that shined in the morning sun, flowing down her back.</p>

            <p>Subaru stopped in his tracks at the sight of her ethereal beauty. Then, placing her hands on her hips in front of disheartened Subaru, she continued with an air like that of an elder sister scolding her mischievous younger brother.</p>

            <p>"It's the same for me."</p>

            <p>"—Huh?"</p>

            <p>"I am aware of your efforts as well, Subaru. So don’t be despondent, okay?" She tilted her head a bit and asked, “Understood?”</p>

            <p>At her words, the startled Subaru hurriedly recovered and nodded vigorously. Seeing his reaction, a smile spread across Emilia's face.</p>

            <p>“Really, what're you doing this time? You're moving like a broken toy. You're always like this.”</p>

            <p>"No, I wasn’t deliberately... Wait, if I wasn’t aiming for that, it's you who's a hundred times more unfair, Emilia. No matter how much I scratch and claw, I just keep falling for you..."</p>

            <p>"Yes, yes. Dodging the question like that, it's a bad habit, isn't it?" She replied.</p>

            <p>Emilia, with a small smile on her face, didn't seem interested in their attempted heart-to-heart talk. As she swept back her flowing silver hair with one hand, he stood next to her, Subaru, thoroughly convinced that he could never match up to her.</p>

            <p>No matter how many times they walked side by side like this, each encounter with Emilia felt refreshingly new to Subaru. There was never the same Emilia twice. If he let today pass by, there would never again be another day to meet the Emilia of today. He never thought he could spend his days in such a way, cherishing the time and looking forward to tomorrow.</p>

            <p>"I'm working energetically and deepening my relationship with the girl I have my eyes on... What a healthy life. Nobody should be able to call me a shut-in anymore!"</p>

            <p>"Boys can be stubborn, that's fine. But you can't forget to take care of your health. Even now, there is absolutely no need to push yourself. You should accept with gratitude the kindness Rem and Ram show you... Well, mostly Rem."</p>

            <p>Misunderstanding Subaru's fired-up resolution, Emilia warns him. Apparently, in her eyes, Subaru already had a reputation as a rather principled, good young man. To the point where he might overwork himself if he pushed too hard.</p>

            <p>Of course, the real Subaru is far from being labor-minded. If he could live without working, he would want to lead a life of eating, sleeping and playing all day long.</p>

            <p>Despite that, he is not honest enough to correct such favorable misunderstandings.</p>

            <p>In the midst of all this talk, Roswaal's mansion starts to come into view from across the road. They're just a few minutes away from reaching it - their enjoyable morning conversation is nearing its end.</p>

            <p>"The time flies when we're talking... Why have you slowed down all of a sudden?"</p>

            <p>"My bittersweet, feminine resistance that doesn't want to let go of this time - It's a slow-footed tactic. Let's enjoy more of this fresh early morning air without any interruptions. Who with? With me, of course!"</p>

            <p>"I think if you go much slower, the two of them will be upset... I told you not to push yourself. But you need to keep your promises. I have a pact with a spirit, after all."</p>

            <p>"I'm weak when it comes to speaking my mind... Once Puck wakes up, there won't be any interruptions and I'll be able to have lovey-dovey talks with Emilia."</p>

            <p>When faced with the contract of the Spirit Arts user, there's nothing I can do.</p>

            <p>Holding back tears of frustration deep within, Subaru concealed his true feelings behind his poker face. "Alright, let's go back... Damn, I should've done better...!"</p>

            <p>"I might not understand what exactly you are upset about, but I'll listen when we get some time. Don't sulk about it, okay?" Emilia retorted with an all too familiar gesture, placing a finger on her lips with an exasperated smile on her face. Each time, Subaru found himself utterly enchanted by her.</p>

            <p>Yet, as Subaru was ensnared by Emilia's allure, she softly muttered, "Oh?", attracting his attention. "There's a dragon carriage in front of the mansion."</p>

            <p>"Eh?" At her mutter, Subaru followed her gaze only to narrow his eyes at the object of her interest.</p>

            <p>A vehicle reminiscent of a "carriage" could be seen parked at the entrance of Roswaal's estate. Subaru described it as "carriage-like" due to its marked difference from what he recognized as a "carriage" from his knowledge.</p>

            <p>After all, instead of horses, the carriage was being drawn by creatures resembling large lizards. Therefore, it didn't seem right to call it a carriage. Subaru hoped the expression 'carriage-like' could be excused.</p>

            <p>However, Subaru recognized this bizarre-looking vehicle. "I believe I've seen these commonly weaving through the capital", he mused.</p>

            <p>He could hardly forget the sight of that beast, stirring up a cloud of dust as it ran through the market on the first day he was summoned to this other world. Since the term "carriage" was understood, he knew that horses existed, but given the frequency of these lizard-drawn vehicles, it could be considered that these creatures are the standard mode of transport.</p>

            <p>"Have I heard it incorrectly, or did they call these dragon carriages?" Subaru enquired.</p>

            <p>"...? Yes. It's called a dragon carriage because it's pulled by ground dragons. Wait, don't tell me this is another misunderstanding of mine? Is there a proper term for it?"</p>

            <p>Emilia was seemingly terrified of her realization about the possible inaccuracies in her knowledge as a result of Subaru's question leaning on his zero-knowledge of this world. As she became flustered over his words, Subaru reassured her with a wave of his hand.</p>

            <p>"No, no. Just that I am the one lacking knowledge. I'm pretty sure you are correct, Emilia-tan, be confident."</p>

            <p>"Really? You're not teasing me? I seriously don't want to say something half-remembered and embarrass myself in a formal place. If you're lying, I'll hit you."</p>

            <p>"Hit me, seriously...you don't hear that every day..."</p>

            <p>While they were speaking, they arrived at the aforementioned dragon carriage. Up close, what surprised them was the quite realistic, enormous lizard—a lizard dragging a wagon. And on the driver's seat of that wagon - a carriage intended for carrying passengers - sat a man, looking much like a coachman. As the two approached, he immediately stood up from the ground where he sat,</p>

            <p>"Welcome back. My apologies for being in front of the gate."</p>

            <p>The elderly gentleman, as it seemed appropriate to call him, straightened himself, causing a similar straightening in them. Given that he was driving this carriage, it could be assumed that the rider was also someone of substantial standing. A peek inside the carriage revealed that it was empty, suggesting,</p>

            <p>"The messenger is already inside the mansion. I believe he's now meeting with Mr. Mathers, the margrave."</p>

            <p>"This is quite courteous. Though, it's embarrassing to be caught peeking so blatantly. Unfortunately, I'm not well-accustomed to this context, please bear with me."</p>

            <p>In response to the unusually candid exchange, Subaru wrapped his seemingly polite response in chaos. However, Emilia, standing next to him, gave Subaru a look that seemed to say, "I knew you could speak properly after all," making him painfully aware of their lack of sophistication compared to those around them.</p>

            <p>Taking the place of the silent Subaru, Emilia stepped forward to the coachman.</p>

            <p>"You mentioned a messenger …could it be?"</p>

            <p>With no subject in her question, the servant took a bow and responded,</p>

            <p>"Just as you've imagined, Lady Emilia, it has to do with the royal election."</p>

            <p>Subaru's head jerked up at the mention of the ‘royal election,’ a term that had been far from his thoughts for awhile now.</p>

            <p>Emilia's expression hardened naturally, and Subaru furrowed his brows at the ominous turn of events. The elderly gentleman, still in his bowed position, went on.</p>

            <p>"I believe you will hear more from the messenger himself. Please proceed to the mansion."</p>

            <p>"A summons, I presume."</p>

            <p>"Please, hear more from the messenger himself."</p>

            <p>Understanding her place, Emilia simply responded “understood” with a stern expression, retracted her chin, and then announced,</p>

            <p>"Let's go."</p>

            <p>Brusquely, she decided to leave - not even bothering to turn towards Subaru, she began walking. Towards the entrance of the mansion.</p>

            <p>Startled, Subaru followed behind her in a quick trot.</p>

            <p>Finally, he glances back fleetingly.</p>

            <p>... The coachman was still silently continuing to see the two off, his head bowed in their direction.</p>
