            <p>Heinkel Astrea was no "Stargazer."</p>

            <p>As you know, he was neither a "Sword Saint" nor did he bear the sword name of "Van," awarded for achievements earned through swordsmanship; even his position as deputy commander of the Royal Guard of the Kingdom of Lugunica was merely for show.</p>

            <p>He was a man who was chosen by nothing that one had to be chosen for, and that remained true even after coming to the Vollachian Empire.</p>

            <p>He joined battles as they came, his heart broke at sights too surreal for this world, he picked up his life where he had fled, and clung to the weak hope that awaited him upon his return.</p>

            <p>That hope was nothing more than an exit sign, enticingly presented by someone who saw Heinkel merely as a disposable pawn, and he was too obtuse to realise that he had abandoned all thought.</p>

            <p>Because of that, unlike Rowan Segmunt, who went against the battle policy for insane reasons, he was trying to fulfill his duty properly and ended up drawing the worst lot.</p>

            <p>"Damn it all..."</p>

            <p>Charged with covering both the southwestern and southeastern points, which he was meant to share with Rowan— key positions in the defense of the Imperial Capital's walls—Heinkel chose to take on the southwestern peak known as the Fourth alone. It was closer to the retreating forces and deemed the rightful target for recapture.
            In other words, it was a sound judgment, far from anything extravagant—a perfectly reasonable choice.
            And at the end of this sound and reasonable choice, Heinkel encountered...</p>

            <p>"—I am Mezoreia. Obeying the voice of my beloved child, I shall become the wind descending from the heavens."</p>

            <p>There, spreading its wings as if to protect the Fourth apex, was the majestic white dragon—.</p>

            <p>△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>The room was carelessly piled with all sorts of jewels.</p>

            <p>Crafted objects lavished with gold and silver, garments studded with gemstones, hair ornaments, and various masterpieces were strewn all over, making the room a cacophony of glittering chaos.
            In the center of such a dazzling room, Madelyn Eschart awoke.</p>

            <p>"—"</p>

            <p>Her golden eyes, sweetly layered with reality, blinked several times. She shook the two black horns protruding from her sky-blue hair, and her petite body rose. Instantly, the jewels around her collided, tumbled, and scattered roughly across the floor, but Madeline paid no mind.</p>

            <p>She quite liked baubles and trinkets like these jewels and treasures.
            She wasn't fond of humans—they were noisy and weak—however, there was an irreplaceable allure in the crafts they made with gemstones and gold.
            Fulfilling the tasks ordered by humans and receiving these as rewards wasn't a bad deal.
            Piling them up in her lair, stuffing them in, and sleeping surrounded by them even contributed to Madeline's peaceful slumber.—However, jewels and gold could not fill the void in her heart.</p>

            <p>"—"</p>

            <p>Shakily standing up, she turned her head and pushed open the door of her lair.
            This lair was hastily prepared anew after the recent events, unlike the lair where Madeline had spent time after becoming one of the "Nine Divine Generals."
            It lacked her own scent, and the treasures were just a collection of what could be found in the castle, far from satisfactory, but better than nothing.
            Above all, there was a reason here that made it worth abandoning her familiar lair to move.</p>

            <p>That reason was—
            "—Caryon."</p>

            <p>Exiting the lair and crossing the hallway, she emerged onto a balcony caressed by a tepid breeze. There, resting its wings, was a wyvern.
            "—"</p>

            <p>At the call of its name, the wyvern—its scales marred by painful cracks—turned its head towards her, its dull black eyes betraying a golden iris, exhibiting the stark emptiness of a lifeless vessel.
            Like the rising tide of humans, not a few wyverns had been dragged from that world to this one.
            However, while the wild creatures of the fields could not communicate their will, with selected beings like the wyvern Caryon before her, communication was possible.
            Indeed, in response to Madeline's address, Caryon quietly bowed its head.</p>

            <p>Other deceased wyverns—corpsewyverns—would mercilessly attack even if the opponent was Madeline, as long as they perceived it as a living being.
            And of course, for such presumptuous creatures, she would not hesitate to shatter them without mercy.
            "Dragons, I'd hate to break you apart, would I not?"</p>

            <p>She stroked the neck of the bowing Caryon and her lips tightened at the coldness. Wyverns, in general, had cooler body temperatures due to their lean physique adapted for flight. Yet, the cold that transferred to her fingertips was like touching the gemstones on display.
            The difference was that unlike the stones, there was no glitter or beauty to be felt.
            And yet, the preciousness of Caryon moving and being present before her eyes could not be replaced.</p>

            <p>For Madeline, Caryon was the first wyvern she ever saw being tamed by a human.
            Madeline, the last of the dragonfolk, had lived completely untouched by life outside the sea of clouds due to her Mezoreian nature.
            Except for Mezoreia, her interactions were limited to the wild wyverns dwelling around the sea of clouds, which were nothing more than subservient to a dragonfolk.</p>

            <p>The insurmountable difference between dragonfolk like herself and the wyverns was grounded in instinct, without room for why or for what purpose. There is no grief or doubt for an absolute divide taken for granted. One who has never seen the beauty of gold does not desire a gold crown.</p>

            <p>However, Madeline's fulfilled days, ignorant of the world beyond the sea of clouds, abruptly ended.
            The one who brought that end was none other than Caryon, the wyvern—when it eschewed ascending because of the presence of the "Cloud Dragon" Mezoreia, it was pacified and brought into the midst of the clouds by a stray one—.
            "Where might your lord, Balroy, be, dragon?"</p>

            <p>While tickling the underside of Caryon's neck with her fingers, Madeline posed the question. The name uttered was all too familiar to Caryon, and it seeped through Madeline's chest like a slow poison.
            The painful sting of this poison, which seemed to even eat away at the soul, was what drove Madeline to leave the sea of clouds and descend to where the humans dwelled.</p>

            <p>But now, this toxic pain was beginning to turn into something different.
            "—"
            Amidst tasting the poison's sting in her heart, Madeline. Beside her, the petted Caryon slowly lifted its head and let out a quiet croon.
            Realizing its gestures and call signaled something behind, Madeline turned around.
            There, emerging from the passageway that connected to the balcony, came a figure. This figure waved flutteringly, taking a far too familiar stance with the dragonfolk.
            "...Such rudeness, were it not for you, I'd bite them to shreds with dragon's fangs."</p>

            <p>"Of course, if it weren't for me, who would dare to show such an attitude towards the dignified dragon-beings?" he said, wanting to emphasize his point. "However, it appears that even amongst the 'Generals,' there are those who lack courtesy."</p>

            <p>"Exactly, I'm so fed up with these humans," another voice added with disgust.</p>

            <p>"Haha, I have no words to return to that," he laughed bitterly, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

            <p>Madeline let out an exasperated sigh at the man's gestures. She felt an unmistakable whiff of emotion mixed with her breath, and to hide this colorful sigh, as if cautioning her unsettled heart, she swept her hand in the air, trying to dismiss it.</p>

            <p>Unmistakable emotion—it was an unbridled passion for the person before her.</p>

            <p>Although his face and the structure of his eyes had completely changed, emotions could not lie. She felt an even stronger reverence for him than she had for Kallion when he was turned into a Draugr.</p>

            <p>"Balroy, where have you been?" Madeline stepped closer and demanded.</p>

            <p>He had been by her side when she fell asleep in the nest filled with treasures. She wished he had stayed by her side until she awoke.</p>

            <p>Sensing her unspoken feelings, Balroy put a hand to his head and said apologetically, "Well, it seems we have rats scurrying around the capital. His Excellency Paladin complained about them catching his eye, so I've been out on reconnaissance and reporting back."</p>

            <p>"Rats... did you kill them properly?"</p>

            <p>"No, these are some tough rats. When I told him I let one escape, His Excellency Paladin was furious, to the point of strangulation."</p>

            <p>With a loose shake of his head, Balroy's words caused Madeline's pupils to narrow. The Paladin he mentioned must be one of the restored Volakian imperial family. A member of a clan that practices fratricide to ascend to the throne, and a magi-eyed man who lost to Emperor Vincent and was resurrected afterward.</p>

            <p>"If those rats trouble the dragon's husband, the dragons wouldn't mind tearing them apart with their own hands," Madeline warned.</p>

            <p>"Don't say such frightening things. Even if they once died, members of the Volakian imperial family... Not a few are unconditionally loyal amongst the resurrected ones. You'd be making enemies by turning them against you."</p>

            <p>"Dragons and Balroy, defeated by those who already died!?" she exclaimed incredulously.</p>

            <p>That was a gross misunderstanding.</p>

            <p>In the presence of Madeline and Balroy, united, the undead stood no chance. If they dared to interfere, it was only right to pulverize them all. Madeline's breath roughened, though Balroy gently restrained her slender shoulders.</p>

            <p>"It's different. It's a problem beyond winning or losing."</p>

            <p>"What do you mean..."</p>

            <p>"You understand, don't you? Our freedom as specters is held in the hands of 'that witch.'"</p>

            <p>Madeline clenched her back teeth hard, rendered silent by Balroy's admonishing remarks. The "witch" was the person responsible for turning the capital into a den of undead and the very reason why Balroy and Kallion now stood before Madeline like this.</p>

            <p>The "witch," with a body similar in construct to the unnatural dragon carapace of Mesoreia, had touched upon the mysteries of Od Laguna, unknown even to Madeline, who was of dragon descent.</p>

            <p>That's why she was able to resurrect so many souls, reproducing them in their states from before death.</p>

            <p>However, if the "witch" whimsically decided to interrupt this miracle—</p>

            <p>"Indeed, if we fought, you and I could probably defeat most foes," Madeline acknowledged. "But just us two, and one beast against His Excellency Paladin who can control hundreds, maybe thousands. It's unclear whom the 'witch' would find more useful."</p>

            <p>"Would she choose humans over the dragons?"</p>

            <p>"I don't know. After all, nobody understands what grand desire the 'witch' harbors."</p>

            <p>It was frustrating, but there was truth in Balroy's words.</p>

            <p>Who knows what the "witch" was thinking? She held Madeline in the crystal palace, under the condition that she cooperates. It was infuriating to be used by someone else, but she had swallowed that humiliation the moment she descended to the surface and accepted Berstetz's suggestion.</p>

            <p>The only thing that was hard to swallow was the uncertainty of the opponent's motives.</p>

            <p>Silently—</p>

            <p>As long as the "witch's" objectives remained unknown, Madeline was in a state like having the sword's edge perpetually against the dragon's reverse scale.</p>

            <p>Without that obstacle, Balroy wouldn't simply resign himself to this situation—he would have fled beyond the sea of clouds with Madeline and fulfilled their promised marriage.</p>

            <p>That unfulfilled promise...</p>

            <p>"We're finally together again."</p>

            <p>"...Madeline"</p>

            <p>Overwhelmed by impulse, Madeline clasped Balroy's body before her. He was much taller than the petite Madeline, and when she leaned into him, her black horns nearly pricked his neck. Skillfully avoiding it, Balroy gently patted her back.</p>

            <p>Her eyes moistened as she remembered the time when, overwhelmed by emotion, she had hugged him so tightly that her horns had pierced him, causing a bloody disaster.</p>

            <p>The body she clung to was cold, and the skin she touched lacked warmth.</p>

            <p>His eyes, as blue as Madeline's hair, now held a blackness devoid of heat with hints of gold, and it was difficult to discern his emotions from his appearance.</p>

            <p>Yet, they shared memories. He knew her wishes.</p>

            <p>He had died, they had parted in death, and now she was touching him again, his body devoid of blood and warmth. So what?</p>

            <p>"Balroy is here. The dragon... wants nothing more."</p>

            <p>Living or dying didn't matter.</p>

            <p>The dead do not necessarily have to remain beneath the earth. If they inadvertently overflow to the surface, and among them, someone precious is found, who then has the right to deny this abhorrent miracle and declare it a mistake?</p>

            <p>Before Madeline Eichhardt, the dragon-being, who could speak thus?</p>

            <p>"—They're coming."</p>

            <p>Buried in the chest of her beloved, enjoying their cold reunion, Madeline murmured deeply.</p>

            <p>Sensing what her voice indicated, Balroy, who had been kindly patting her back, stopped and turned his gaze outside the balcony—far to the south of the imperial city.</p>

            <p>She had caught it. Madeline's senses—no, the senses of Mesoreia's dragon carapace.</p>

            <p>Whatever approached, Madeline was commanded to protect this place.</p>

            <p>Let it be said again. It was a vexing assignment. Nevertheless, Madeline did not hesitate. What she desired was right here.</p>

            <p>"I'll be back. Balroy, this time—"</p>

            <p>"I understand. I'll stay by your side until I'm called."</p>

            <p>"—That's what I expect from a dragon's fine mate."</p>

            <p>Words like 'never leave' or 'always stay' were not uttered, for they were promises impossible to keep.</p>

            <p>Balroy, light-hearted and aware of the extent of his reach, allowed Madeline to love him sincerely without expectations or disappointments.</p>

            <p>Confirming it once more, a breath leaves Madeleine's body, and all strength drains from her form.</p>

            <p>"..."</p>

            <p>Madeleine's limbs go limp, and she collapses on the spot. Barloy quickly pulls her close to him, supporting her weight—a weight that belies her tiny stature with a firm grip.</p>

            <p>Thus, he lifts Madeleine, who has lost—or rather regained—consciousness.</p>

            <p>"..."</p>

            <p>"I understand. We'll carry her gently," Barloy assures in a low murmur.</p>

            <p>The little dragon growls softly, concerned about the slackness of Madeleine's body.</p>

            <p>Acknowledging the carillon's cry, Barloy once again casts his gaze upon the capital and murmurs,</p>

            <p>"Even in death, we can meet again. That's all I wish for. Same for you, Madeleine—if only we can meet again."</p>

            <p>△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>The battle commenced with a one-sided beginning and a one-sided conclusion.</p>

            <p>By definition, a battle is the clashing of souls with intent to fight, continuing as long as such willingness endures.</p>

            <p>Following this definition, the swift depletion of one side's will meant that it was not a "battle."</p>

            <p>"..."</p>

            <p>The foe was feeble, barely qualifying as a threat.</p>

            <p>Yet, there was no suitable term other than "threat" for those who approach bearing enmity and malice. Perhaps "insignificant threat" was the most fitting label.</p>

            <p>In truth, the insignificant threat was swept aside with a mere flick of a tail, scattering like leaves and burying itself in the debris of nearby buildings.</p>

            <p>It was an anticlimactic outcome but not something to lament or pity unduly.</p>

            <p>This demonstrated the chasm between dragons and humans—between beings completely mismatched in the hierarchy of life.</p>

            <p>Dragons, differing fundamentally in the essence of their existence, could reduce humans to dust with ease.</p>

            <p>It's an undeniable anomaly that amidst humans, exceptionally rare ones exist that do not succumb to this fate, mutants within their species, so to speak, becoming something other than human.</p>

            <p>Yet, even being this "something else," ultimately, they are but a distant second to the essence of life that dragons embody.</p>

            <p>The fact that must be firmly reasserted, the affirmation of one's rightful place, becomes starkly apparent in the face of an insignificant threat being repelled.</p>

            <p>In this sense, even an insignificant threat had its value, as it served to reinforce the formidable presence of "Cloud Dragon" Mezoreya to the "Witch" and provided dragons with a moment to reassess their own worth.</p>

            <p>"Damn it all..."</p>

            <p>Out of the blue, a curse upon the world itself was heard, and the "Cloud Dragon" paused in its motion.</p>

            <p>The dragon had intended to turn its back on the demolished street and return to the castle walls, to demonstrate that any malevolence approaching would be futile against it.</p>

            <p>The movement halted because a voice that should not have been heard was now audible.</p>

            <p>"..."</p>

            <p>When the dragon slowly turned back, the mountain of rubble crumbled with a rattle.</p>

            <p>Emerging from the ruins of the once towering buildings and streets destroyed by a single whip of its tail was a disheveled human with red hair and blue eyes.</p>

            <p>A human deemed an insignificant threat and duly rendered as such. If this creature, now climbing out, were to draw the sword at its waist for a second round, the "battle" previously deemed finished would instead persist.</p>

            <p>But the human who crawled out bore no trace of fighting spirit or dominance.</p>

            <p>"It's always like this..."</p>

            <p>As if choking on dust inhaled into his lungs, the human muttered bitterly.</p>

            <p>It was a curse, not at the dragon but at the world itself—at the ground beneath his feet, the air enveloping him, everything around him, and above all, at his own existence at the center of it all.</p>

            <p>"At the critical moment, I'm always abandoned by luck—"</p>

            <p>Finding the human's lamentation intolerably unpleasant, the "Cloud Dragon" delivered a second tail strike, this time vertically.</p>

            <p>Rather than accidentally catching someone up while sweeping the street, this blow was aimed squarely at the feeble figure struggling to stand, the dragon's tail lifting to strike down with precision.</p>

            <p>The force of the blow expelled the human body as if it were a kicked pebble, smashing through walls and buildings, streaking through the city's thoroughfares by three or four blocks.</p>

            <p>From above, the orderly layout of the imperial capital stretched out—an inspiring sight.</p>

            <p>And yet, a single body taking flight in chaos, disrupting the order, was ugly and graceless in its manner of flight, in its approach to death, grating on every nerve of the dragon.</p>

            <p>For such a being, it was intolerable for beautiful things to suffer damage.</p>

            <p>And then—</p>

            <p>"..."</p>

            <p>A distant groan was heard from where the human had careened through multiple blocks.</p>

            <p>No matter the extent of the damage, whether barely clinging to life, such sounds should be impossible to hear.</p>

            <p>After receiving the tail strike of a dragon, there should be no life left in the victim.</p>

            <p>"…I am..."</p>

            <p>This should not be.</p>
