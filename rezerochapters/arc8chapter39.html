            <p>Cecilus Segmunt is a "Stargazer."</p>

            <p>This is different from the role within the Vollachian Empire, originally used by Vincent Vollachia when he began to make use of one of their own, Ubilk. It means a "Stargazer" in the truest sense — an existence who receives a divine mission and casts aside all other concerns to fulfill that supreme decree.</p>

            <p>Being a "Stargazer" and receiving a divine mission comes with great compulsion.</p>

            <p>It grants the power to allow a mere male prostitute to freely speak his mind to the emperor, to make a frail mother forget the love she has for the daughter she risked her life to bear, and to so easily let go of a goal one had spent their life and even contemplated suicide to achieve—all through intervention in one's life.</p>

            <p>Most "Stargazers" have their lives twisted by their divine missions, forced to change their ways of living. And they don't think of it as a tragedy.</p>

            <p>Even if it may seem abnormal or pitiable to those around them, that's just how it is.</p>

            <p>Among these "Stargazers," Rowan Segmunt was the sole exception.</p>

            <p>His divine mission aligned with the ambition he had been aiming for, and neither he nor those around him felt that his way of living had been twisted by it.</p>

            <p>How he reconciled his heartfelt wish with the divine mission he received and established his current convictions has already been mentioned, so I will omit it here.</p>

            <p>What needs to be discussed here is the fact that Cecilus Segmunt, who was born into this world at the end of Rowan Segmunt's divine mission, is also a "Stargazer" —</p>

            <p>And within the "Stargazers," Cecilus Segmunt is a unique reality, the only one "beyond conventional bounds."</p>

            <p>△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>As the wind howled and whipped, Cecilus let the hem of his hakama flutter while shielding his brow with his hand as he gazed into the distance.</p>

            <p>Al's proposed strategy was to break through the star-shaped walls that encircled the imperial capital, creating openings at the five points of the formation.</p>

            <p>To bring in reinforcements from outside, it was necessary to punch holes through the solid defenses of the undead. Cecilus welcomed the increase both in actors who would shine on stage and in audiences who would witness his exploits.</p>

            <p>If this groundwork would lead to thrilling developments later on, he wouldn't mind diligently doing the mundane work.</p>

            <p>"But remember! This is all under the premise that there will be a reward for our efforts later on!"</p>

            <p>In theater as in war, there is a right person for every job.</p>

            <p>This world is a stage everywhere one looks — the philosophy of Cecilus could become long-winded, but it comes down to the fact that everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. Cecilus was quite the miscast when it came to meticulous work and steady progress.</p>

            <p>Putting a covering on a leading actor, a star who catches the audience's eye, and making them do work in the shadows would be a dramatic turnaround in every sense of the phrase.</p>

            <p>"Don't you think the audience would agree?"</p>

            <p>Cecilus tilted his head back, looking up at the sky, addressing an invisible interlocutor.</p>

            <p>Ordinarily, speaking to the sky like this, where dark clouds loom, would bring no response from the heavens — not usually, anyways.</p>

            <p>But Cecilus was not ordinary; he was a star actor in this world.</p>

            <p>— Voices from the audience, audible to no one else, echoed back to only Cecilus.</p>

            <p>Loud whispers, overbearingly frivolous, godly though ignorant of etiquette, spoke to Cecilus.</p>

            <p>They also —</p>

            <p>『■■■■』『■●■●■●■』『――■■』『●●●●●！！』『■■■■●●■■』『●●■■●■■●●』『■■！！』『●●●■■■』『■■■●■●●■■●●』『●●■●■●●●●■■●――』『●●……■』『●■●■●■●■』</p>

            <p>Overwhelming in vigor and number, they poured down on Cecilus.</p>

            <p>These were not just responses to his statements but voices continuously showering over every single one of Cecilus's actions, compelling him to this or that, since he became aware of his surroundings.</p>

            <p>"Ha ha ha, you’re all so exuberantly cheerful today! I understand, I understand. After all, every little gesture of mine enchants someone! Look forward to the exciting developments that will continue without taking your eyes off me for even a second!"</p>

            <p>For Cecilus, who paid no heed to them, these were the passionate cheers from his fans.</p>

            <p>— As previously mentioned, Cecilus Segmunt is a "Stargazer."</p>

            <p>And like most "Stargazers" — no, even Rowan Segmunt, who seemed an exception, had his life distorted to fulfill his divine mission.</p>

            <p>Such is the compelling force of a divine mission, and the life of a "Stargazer" is dominated by it.</p>

            <p>Except for Cecilus Segmunt, the only "Stargazer beyond conventional bounds."</p>

            <p>"Thank you ever so much for your support. I don't have the slightest idea nor ear for what you're saying, but don't worry! I defy expectations! I meet hopes! That's the way of life for me, a leading actor!"</p>

            <p>"— Hey, you fool. Cut the crap, will you? If you're found, it'll be a huge pain."</p>

            <p>"Whoa there."</p>

            <p>While typically absorbing only the audience's enthusiasm and ignoring the rest, Cecilus turned around at the sound of the bearded canine person — Groovy's call.</p>

            <p>Groovy, with his hands on his hips and a cautious gaze in his eyes, was a sight that Cecilus found absolutely fascinating.</p>

            <p>This beastman warrior, Groovy, of similar height, was very much to Cecilus’s liking.</p>

            <p>Groovy possessed a charming appearance, and his combat skills ranked within the top five that Cecilus had observed since leaving the solitary island. His formidable presence went beyond mere swordsmanship, suggesting intriguing battles yet to come.</p>

            <p>"The only disappointment is your choice of language. Too much foul language diminishes one's dignity! If your rank degrades, no matter how skillful you are, you can’t maintain decorum. If we are going to cross swords, I expect our opponents to have a certain level of class!"</p>

            <p>"Shut up, you idiot! Stop spouting nonsense! First off, who said they'd fight alongside you? That damn Chisha's to blame for all this unnecessary trouble..."</p>

            <p>"Oh dear, I seem to have heard a name. Your cold reply is worrisome, but how is this person related to me, whom you're speaking of?"</p>

            <p>"It's got something to do with your damn shrunken self. — You were shrunk by that damn know-it-all Chisha, that's what."</p>

            <p>Hearing Groovy's reply, "Mmm," hummed Cecilus, pondering.</p>

            <p>The supposed shrunken state was frequently mentioned, yet it still didn't quite click for Cecilus. Whether shrunken or not, Cecilus was entirely present in the moment, and that was all that mattered to him.</p>

            <p>Of course, the aging of Rowan when we haven't met for a while, and the fact that the nickname "Blue Lightning" already known to shake the future world are persuasive. But what puzzles Cecillus is this tale of tiny him made by Mr. Chisha.</p>

            <p>"Ahh? Are you spouting some bullshit that human shrinking isn't possible, you?"</p>

            <p>"No, no, not at all. The human imagination is limitless, and what we envision can be realized. I like the fairness of this world, the stage we're on, so marvels such as human shrinking are certainly possible. What I find hard to believe is quite simple indeed. — Who could possibly exploit such a weakness in me?"</p>

            <p>There was a solemn look on Groovy's face as he responded to Cecilus's hands-clasped-behind-the-head question. Even with his wrinkled brow, there was an endearing quality to Groovy, which made one think that every stage needs a character like him to add some lively banter. It seems that even Groovy was affected by Cecilus's question.</p>

            <p>Cecilus didn't think of himself as invincible or immortal. A gouge in his heart, a severing of his slender neck, or if nearly half of the blood flowing within his body were to spill out, he would lose his life. Humans die.</p>

            <p>However, that being said, who could commit such an act? That single point was something that Groovy too might realize as a contradiction in his own thoughts. Regardless of the opponent, no one could shrink Cecilus, he was certain of that.</p>

            <p>"Maybe that Chisha guy racked his brain or you were fucking careless, huh?"</p>

            <p>"Me?! Careless after you have seen me?!"</p>

            <p>"It's blatantly obvious."</p>

            <p>"Is that so obvious? Ahaha, that's pretty crude, but you've got a point!"</p>

            <p>Laughing and slapping his hands together, Cecilus shook his head in disagreement, as if to say wait a minute. Such a critique made one want to cover their face in disbelief, especially as even a mighty one like Groovy, aware of Cecilus's abilities, could not fully discard such doubts.</p>

            <p>"Apparently, I'm not significant when I'm big! I can never become someone who receives such a deplorable rating from those around me! Just watch me in ten years!"</p>

            <p>"Who's going to cheer on your growth for ten fucking years? Quit yapping and get back to your original size already!"</p>

            <p>"Even if you tell me to get back to size right away, I don't particularly want to return... Besides, do you even know the way back, Mr. Groovy?"</p>

            <p>"I don't know, but that Chisha guy who set it up does. These ninja tricks usually come with some time-restricted or condition-based bullshit. It's gotta be a condition with Chisha."</p>

            <p>"Really? So, is Chisha a ninja? Is he an acquaintance, friend, or relative of that spirited old man?"</p>

            <p>"I don't know, and Chisha isn't a ninja. It's just ninja-like methods... Ah, what a damn hassle.</p>

            <p>Scratching his head, Groovy grumbled like someone who knew too much. Now Cecilus thought he understood; more than knowing who Chisha really was, what was necessary for him was to clear whatever condition had been prepared. Asking about it would probably anger Groovy with a retort like, "How would I know?"</p>

            <p>"What do you think is the condition for me to return?"</p>

            <p>"How the hell would I know!"</p>

            <p>"See there."</p>

            <p>Cecilus smirked as expected, and Groovy grunted unhappily. And as they were talking...</p>

            <p>"Sorry to interrupt your fun chat, but could you take a break from the enjoyment for a bit?"</p>

            <p>"Oh, it's Al."</p>

            <p>With a voice tinged with tired exasperation, Al had come onto the rooftop where Cecilus and his company stood. Al, showing himself from the top of the staircase, tapped on the steps rhythmically and said,</p>

            <p>"Really, please. It's tough when you jump right up to the rooftop, and I'm left taking the stairs. You too, Groovy."</p>

            <p>"Damn, my bad. Got carried away by this fool's chatter."</p>

            <p>Groovy sincerely apologized to Al, who had apparently been waiting downstairs. For Cecilus, he had just climbed up to get a look based on Groovy's curiosity about something across the street, but had gotten too distracted with idle gazing.</p>

            <p>At any rate...</p>

            <p>"Come on, don't be mad, Al. Groovy's even wilting his ears in remorse. You're going to forgive us, right?"</p>

            <p>"You're a go-your-own-way character; that's not news to me. More importantly, did you notice anything while looking around?"</p>

            <p>"Well, yes. It seems like the first, second, and third defenses are quite robust. Thinking about the direction the bosses fled, it seems like a natural precaution."</p>

            <p>"Those three places, huh..."</p>

            <p>Touching the clasp of his helmet with his right hand, Al pondered Cecilus's reply. The numbers Cecilus mentioned referred to the tips of the star-shaped fortifications encircling the imperial capital. The first was at the glittering northern end of the city, followed by the second at the northwest and the third at the northeast. The fourth and fifth were to the southwest and southeast, respectively, with the defenses at the three northern points being strong.</p>

            <p>Conversely, one could say the two southern points are prime targets for an attack. However...</p>

            <p>"It reeks too much like an obvious trap."</p>

            <p>"Mr. Groovy, can your nose detect the smell of such schemes too?"</p>

            <p>"I'm not so oddly made to detect bad plotting! It's just a judgment call as a 'general'. You've shrunk, but don't use that as an excuse... Ah, never mind."</p>

            <p>"What's that? You got me curious now, stopping mid-sentence."</p>

            <p>"The point is, this idiot, even before shrinking, wasn't doing a general's work."</p>

            <p>With a bitter face, Groovy's words led both Cecilus and Al to a nod of agreement. To Cecilus, it felt like not so much an insult but a plain fact. Even if Cecilus had truly shrunk due to carelessness, he couldn't imagine his larger self guiding or supporting anyone.</p>

            <p>So, he had no objection to Groovy's words.</p>

            <p>"But I agree with the opinion that it's all too conspicuous. Still, isn't it curious or rather surprising that Al too is quite the strategist?"</p>

            <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

            <p>"Well, the fourth and fifth appear to be easily attackable, seemingly luring us into a trap... and you sent father and his two friends there, so that makes you quite the strategist."</p>

            <p>Silence ensued.</p>

            <p>Cecilus brought up the two absent members, Rowan and Heinkel, who were undertaking a separate mission. Smiling at Al, who had suggested the team division, it seemed clear that Al had significant intentions for sending the two to the southwest and southeast peaks, the fourth and fifth.</p>

            <p>Faced with Cecilus's smiling visage, Al quietly held his breath and fell silent.</p>

            <p>Presently, Cecilus and his comrades were divided into a team of three and a team of two, as part of their five-member team, engaging in a strategy to conquer the five peaks surrounding them. Al was the one who directed the pair of Rowan and Heinkel to take on the fourth and fifth peaks to the southwest and southeast and his ploy was transparent.</p>

            <p>"If it's an ally we can afford to lose without pain, use them as a decoy to attract the enemy's attention. You may be modest, Mr. Al, but you are indeed a tactician!"</p>

            <p>"...Do you have a complaint about how this man uses your father?"</p>

            <p>"No? It's rather convenient for a performer like myself not to get scattered in a group of five, and from a military standpoint, it's quite the solid plan, isn't it? I mean, it's quite pointless to expect any sort of cooperation from the old man!"</p>

            <p>"Indeed, you're the one fit to say that."</p>

            <p>Regarding cooperation, I guess one could only assume it to be an inherent failing of the Segmunt family.</p>

            <p>Either way, Al had wracked his brain to make effective use of the limited forces at his disposal. One would think that with a head for thinking things through or tactical intuition, one could imagine what role was expected of them.</p>

            <p>"We can't afford to leisurely take down one location at a time. If those middle-aged red and blue guys can't figure it out, I'll have no choice but to make them fulfill their shitty roles, even if they're sacrificial pawns."</p>

            <p>"Yeah. We can't let them amass troops by making a big fuss in one spot."</p>

            <p>"That's why the dispersed attack... Though I must say it was a bit surprising. After all, Mr. Al, you talked like you were comrades with Mr. Heinkel."</p>

            <p>"I'm no hero. I can set my priorities straight."</p>

            <p>That somewhat self-deprecating comment seemed to Cecilus to be not about how Heinkel was used, but about Al's own methods.</p>

            <p>Although Cecilus's impression of Al doesn't change much based on the response―</p>

            <p>"―I see. You're different from the boss, then."</p>

            <p>"――――"</p>

            <p>Al turns his face toward Cecilus, who'd carelessly spouted what was on his mind. The expression on Al's face, hidden behind an iron helmet, and the intensity and fervor of his gaze, at times revealed his inner feelings more eloquently than words or facial expressions ever could.</p>

            <p>"Well, that's just sometimes, not necessarily right now."</p>

            <p>"...I don't get what you're trying to say, but that's fine. I am, indeed, different from my brothers."</p>

            <p>"Hmm? Being different is natural, isn't it? I personally think you're tougher to deal with than the boss."</p>

            <p>Cecilus tilted his head, sensing that somehow the comment implied he was inferior.</p>

            <p>Strong or weak, clean or dirty, liked or disliked, their value is like the phases of the moon – worth a moment's joy or distress, but not heavy enough to tip the scales of life.</p>

            <p>Whether something is right or wrong isn't absolute either.</p>

            <p>"The boss will struggle desperately and in a vulgar manner but will always choose a method that looks good on stage. Al, on the other hand, is different. He's willing to take even the dirtiest, most despised methods after a desperate and muddy struggle. It's not about being better or worse. It's just the difference between the boss and you."</p>

            <p>"――――"</p>

            <p>"Ah, leaving aside the talk of who's better or worse, if it's about how one wants to live, that's another story altogether. How one wishes to be seen by others depends on their own dedication... Even going to the toilet is dirty, but I want to make even that look good!"</p>

            <p>"I was about to start thinking better of you just now...!"</p>

            <p>"Sorry, I just can't get Groovy's phrases out of my head."</p>

            <p>Still, much as Groovy influenced him, Cecilus wasn't lying. He believed that even actions that would make others turn away in disgust deserved attention if one gave them enough reason – the philosophy of a star actor.</p>

            <p>"So? Have we finished this pointless fucking chit-chat? I don't give a shit about life counseling. After this is over, we'll have our fucking reflection meeting at your grave."</p>

            <p>"...You've made quite the impression, haven't you?"</p>

            <p>"Right?"</p>

            <p>Groaning under Groovy's endless curses, Al shrugged his shoulders, and Cecilus laughed.</p>

            <p>Although he had engaged in awkward reasoning unfitting for the topic at hand, Cecilus had no objection to Al's strategy; it didn't bother him if Rowan and Heinkel suffered greatly as long as the plan proceeded.</p>

            <p>However, Cecilus had one concern about Al's plan, which he kept to himself.</p>

            <p>"Will that supremely selfish father of mine really comply with what Mr. Al says?"</p>

            <p>Cecilus didn't voice what was on his mind for once, a rare occurrence because he had completely written off his father, Rowan, regarding his nature.</p>

            <p>Rowan does what he wants and nothing he doesn't want to do.</p>

            <p>It's a trait inherited by Cecilus, but he and Rowan are different. It was the same as the earlier conversation with Al about differences with his boss, Schwarz.</p>

            <p>It's not about right or wrong. It's about living and dying.</p>

            <p>"So, Shit-Helmet, how are you planning to attack?"</p>

            <p>"――. The Crystal Palace is out of the question, which leaves us with target two or three... I want to avoid the area with that sniper. So, number three."</p>

            <p>"Aww! I wanted revenge though!"</p>

            <p>"Don't talk crap when we can't afford it! What do you think we're up against――"</p>

            <p>"Fine, got it."</p>

            <p>Cecilus reluctantly withdrew his argument, pouting his lips to Groovy's shout. Then, with his reaction, the previously raised fist of Groovy widened his eyes.</p>

            <p>"You listened obediently for once. You've gotten shittier after you shrank."</p>

            <p>"Hmm, that doesn't feel like a compliment, does it?"</p>

            <p>"Shut up! We don't have fucking time. Let's go."</p>

            <p>With a jerk of his chin, Groovy turned towards the third target's location, and as Cecilus was about to follow with a "Yes, sir!", the plan's originator Al voiced out, "Is that okay?"</p>

            <p>"I answered because I was asked, but you guys... no, you know more about the imperial city than I do."</p>

            <p>"I wouldn't nod along to a shitty suggestion. I have no complaints about your strategy... I also don't want to deal with that idiot Balleroy."</p>

            <p>"―Because you're former comrades?"</p>

            <p>"That, and because he's fucking strong. If I have to fight that guy, i'd rather it be underground. I won't lose."</p>

            <p>The sniper's strength as asserted by Groovy is undeniable.</p>

            <p>Cecilus had encountered the sniper several times in this imperial city, yet he had never clearly seen his opponent. Strong, there was no mistake about it. Perhaps agreeing earlier was a mistake. Is it too late to whine and get some support for a change of plan? Probably.</p>

            <p>"Let's set things in motion quickly. Since we're not trying to keep the hole open, there's no point delaying."</p>

            <p>"Be careful. This idiot is planning to take care of things quickly and go looking for Balleroy."</p>

            <p>"―Once the main event is over, be sure to do just that."</p>

            <p>"How dare you imply you're the star of the show over me!"</p>

            <p>Softly shaking his head from side to side, Al muttered in resignation while Cecillus retorted with his grievance.</p>

            <p>△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>The journey toward the third location was unexpectedly smooth.</p>

            <p>They happened upon few troubles with the living dead scouting for survivors during their passage, not that there weren’t any to be seen. Yet, those who blocked the path were nothing but a hindrance to be eliminated, and those who did not were merely extras in passing.</p>

            <p>Would any actor willingly give a supporting role its moment in the limelight just to enliven the stage?</p>

            <p>"Unfortunately, the audience's interest is finite. I won't say that we don't need supporting actors who can elevate the overall quality of the play, but whether they are desired is another matter altogether... Nevertheless,"</p>

            <p>Whilst enjoying a tranquil journey, Cecilus furrowed his brow in contemplation.</p>

            <p>Of course, he was all for cutting out unnecessary trouble, and Cecilus himself did not fancy a spectacle that required laboriously dealing with mere foot soldiers.</p>

            <p>However, the way Cecilus and his companions appeared now might be considered somewhat ungraceful.</p>

            <p>After all, Cecilus was perched on Al's back, with Groovy clinging to his belly—forming a sandwich around Al. The reason for this peculiar arrangement was to prevent them from protruding from the edges of the cloak that Al wore over his head.</p>

            <p>"But this looks ridiculous! This isn't how I should be promoting myself, Groovy-san!"</p>

            <p>"Shut up! Even if we're hiding our presence, sounds and smells can still be detected! It'd be a damn hassle if those around us notice and surround us!"</p>

            <p>"You two are too loud...! And stop shaking, I'm going to fall...!"</p>

            <p>As he swayed on Al's shoulders in discomfort, Cecilus was snapped at by the two sharing the same cloak.</p>

            <p>Groovy's crafted hide was quite the remarkable item. According to what I've heard, wearing it makes one less noticeable. Groovy, along with Rowan and Heinkel, had utilized these skins to sneak into the imperial capital undetected by enemies.</p>

            <p>Indeed, although they had chosen paths less trodden, none of the living dead had spotted the trio, likely thanks to the efficacy of their disguise.</p>

            <p>"With our size difference, it's stifling enough, but I can't imagine how you three managed to enter the capital with your fathers. And where on earth did you get such an odd cloak?"</p>

            <p>"I didn't buy it. I made it. You've forgotten, too stupid to remember, but I also reforged your 'Fiend Sword' by melting it down into a blade."</p>

            <p>"Oh, 'Fiend Sword'! That's a cool name! I would love to see it, to know more about it, to admire it!"</p>

            <p>"That's because it's your damn sword!"</p>

            <p>Groovy performed the difficult feat of yelling in a hushed voice.</p>

            <p>Putting aside whether it was shrunk or not, listening to stories about Cecilus that he himself was not aware of was fascinating, especially tales about swords, which were of particular interest to him.</p>

            <p>"Then you reforged it into a sword, how intriguing. Are you a swordsmith as well, Groovy-san? Busy with the role of 'General' and as a blacksmith too."</p>

            <p>"I'm not specialized in swords alone. I forge swords, weave garments, and manipulate magical artifacts."</p>

            <p>"Which means, this peculiar cloak is also some kind of magical artifact?"</p>

            <p>"Nah, it’s just a werewolf's hide."</p>

            <p>Cecilus responded with an impressed "oh," while Al shuddered at Groovy's reply. Cecilus examined the hide cloaks intently.</p>

            <p>"Werewolves are quite rare, aren't they? I know they exist but never had the chance to encounter one."</p>

            <p>"They're damn hard to find. Like land dragons or the Ulh people from the Holy Kingdom, their entire race is blessed. Skin them alive, and the blessing stays within the hide. It's an effective re-purposing of those deceiving bastards’ skills."</p>

            <p>"A Blessing of Concealment..."</p>

            <p>"Huh? Quite an old-fashioned name you know. 'Blessing of Deception' is more common... not that tales of werewolves are common at all."</p>

            <p>Al murmured those words softly, which Groovy caught and expounded upon his knowledge.</p>

            <p>After all, in the empire, werewolves were shunned, stemming from an ancient and ancient tale. Of course, since the story is based on historical facts, it deeply links to reality.</p>

            <p>Cecilus himself had no particular hostility towards werewolves or werebeings—</p>

            <p>"The irony that the hide of a werewolf, considering how they are seen in the empire, has come to our rescue. No pun intended."</p>

            <p>"——"</p>

            <p>"Huh? Ignored? Are you ignoring me? I thought it was quite a clever pun—"</p>

            <p>Just as Cecilus touched upon the topic of the hide cloaks and thought Al and Groovy returned a dismissive response—he realised that he was not the reason.</p>

            <p>"——■■■■■■■■"</p>

            <p>As usual, the disturbance was not due to the noisy bystanders.</p>

            <p>Cecilus felt tension engulfing Al's entire body, which he was clinging to, and that tension seeped into Cecilus as well.</p>

            <p>Irrespective of the previous discussion about shrinking, something clutched Cecilus's thin heart inexorably.</p>

            <p>—Gray thorns swirled around in Cecilus's chest.</p>

            <p>"Do you two see this as well?"</p>

            <p>"…Yep. Hey, Groovy-san. If we have this cloak, we shouldn’t be found so easily..."</p>

            <p>"Damn it...! Such a bloody annoying trick...!"</p>

            <p>It seemed that Al and Groovy were experiencing the same situation, with Groovy particularly infuriated by the realization that someone had seen through the effects of his prized hide creation—or so it seemed at first.</p>

            <p>If the adversary had pinpointed their location, they wouldn’t have left the sandwiched trio unattended for so long. Of course, there was the possibility that it was intended as a warning.</p>

            <p>"It doesn't seem to be indiscriminate. What do you think?"</p>

            <p>"–– It's a reckless area attack. Which damn fool is it!? Who is using such an idiotic curse...!"</p>

            <p>Groovy quivered with rage as he cursed the unknown perpetrator of the thorns.</p>

            <p>At that moment, the thorns at each of their hearts began to writhe slowly, and sharp spines slipping through their fingers signaled the impending full force of the curse.</p>

            <p>And then––</p>

            <p>"––Apparently, the world refuses to acknowledge that I am here. Ah, behold the arrival of a new ordeal! Let's overcome this with flair and fanfare!"</p>

            <p>Just before the excruciating pain gripped their hearts, this exultant exclamation spilled from the laughing outsider.</p>
