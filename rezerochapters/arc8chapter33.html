        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>Gustav Morello, the Regional Director of the "Gladiator Island" Ginunhive.</p>

            <p>The position bestowed upon him by Vincent Vollachia, the Emperor of the magnificent Holy Empire of Vollachia, held supreme meaning. In Vollachia, where every citizen adheres to the doctrine "Be diligent and strong", the expectation for the island's sword-fighting performance is exceptionally high in peacetime. This was not just for mere entertainment, but rather to keep away the citizen's minds from "conflicts" and to keep their fangs sharp during the current Emperor's reign, which even doused the seeds of civil war to embers.</p>

            <p>While this had never been explicitly stated, this was the role that Gustav had understood he had to fulfill when he was assigned as the director of Gununhaib by Emperor Vincent Vollachia. Indeed, Gustav had fulfilled his role as the island's director more properly than any predecessor until today.</p>

            <p>"Gustav Morello has arrived with the gladiators of Ginunhive for the rallying," said Gustav, bowing with all four of his arms touching the ground, before Emperor Vincent Vollachia who stood before him.</p>

            <p>What has shaken the entire empire was the grand internal strife, its foundation completely crumbled because of the wrench thrown in by the dead. To escape from the army of rampaging undead, mass evacuation of the citizens from the imperial city and its surroundings had been carried out. The warriors from both the regular and rebel army were forced to co-operate to face this destruction. The evacuation of too many citizens is still ongoing, yet, more than half of them have been accommodated in the fortress city, Garkla. Gustav was granted an audience with Vincent right after he joined in to aid the large number of evacuating citizens and entered Garkla.</p>

            <p>In the corner of the fort, next to the kneeling Gustav, stood Idra Missanga with a bewildered look on his face. The faction of lawless gladiators, now reformed as "The Pleiades Battalion", had Natsuki Subaru as the leader with Gustav as his staff officer. The one Gustav chose to assist him in this job was Idra. Of all the gladiators who were closely related to Subaru, Idra, who was both contemplative and calm, was an invaluable asset in the rowdy battalion. However, he was still not at ease being suddenly presented before the Emperor.</p>

            <p>“I have received a report about your work from Zikr Osman. Plus, that guy… Natsuki Schwartz was also boasting about his achievements quite a lot,”</p>

            <p>“Boasting… huh?”</p>

            <p>Overwhelmed by tension, Idra unintentionally muttered and turned pale as a sheet. Vincent, who narrowed his black eyes while silently staring, was infamous for his ruthlessly aggressive nature, extremely opposite to his graceful and delicate appearance. It was understandable for the Empire’s citizens to prepare for death simply by being in his field of vision, as they were only aware of the Emperor through rumors.</p>

            <p>However, Gustav, who was still kneeling, looked up at Vincent and said,</p>

            <p>“Your Majesty, this individual is Idra Missanga. He is one of the gladiators and has been supporting his profession in ways that others couldn't. Please, as soon as the current chaos is settled, offer him amnesty…”</p>

            <p>“You're unusually talkative, Gustav Morello. But…”</p>

            <p>“――Huh?”</p>

            <p>“I understand if you say he is valuable. Continue working hard. If you want to discuss post-war matters, make sure to leave enough achievements and life behind to be able to discuss after the war.”</p>

            <p>“A-Ah! Your benevolence is such a fortune!”</p>

            <p>With utmost excitement, Idra bowed his head so much that he almost hit his forehead on the floor. Idra was so overwhelmed by the feeling of having been granted a life-saving grace that he wasn't aware of his surroundings.</p>

            <p>Though he was only the son of a humble miller, he was unaware that he had received a rather extraordinary praise from Vincent. Of course, Gustav believes that Idra's contribution deserves such recognition, but he also noticed a change in Vincent - his tolerance towards others.</p>

            <p>Vincent had always been a wise emperor, perhaps too wise. Therefore, those who could not share the clear vision of this far-seeing emperor, found Vincent to be rather cold. Hence, the people around him had to make all efforts to understand the emperor’s perspective.</p>

            <p>However, Vincent did not just acknowledge it, but he seemed to think it wasn’t enough.</p>

            <p>“But, they sure took some extraordinary risks,”</p>

            <p>Suddenly, Vincent's voice interrupted Gustav’s train of thought. To the Emperor's words, Gustav stayed kneeling, closed his mouth letting out a faint growl, and waited for Vincent's following words. In response to Gustav's silence, Vincent narrowed his black eyes.</p>

            <p>"I thought I had sent you to serve as the Governor of 'Gladiator Island'. And yet, in this crisis you abandon your post, leading the island's gladiators on a march to the far-east Capital. I am surprised you have the gall to show your lone head before the Emperor, at whose very presence even the earth trembles," Vincent questioned, leaning his cheek on his hand from his large chair. From nearby, a soft groan could be heard from Idra.</p>

            <p>Gustav's actions were a clear disrespect to the emperor, the kind of situation that would make regular citizens think of death.</p>

            <p>"— May I offer some explanations?"</p>

            <p>"I'll allow it. However, choose your words carefully. Even if you were to lose both arms, you’d still be useful as a common man, would you not?"</p>

            <p>And yet, without sinking into despair, Gustav dared to reply to the Emperor. Vincent accepted his words with a look that could be interpreted as either sadistic or provocative.</p>

            <p>Before it, Gustav was surprisingly calm, even more so than he himself imagined. Perhaps this was the influence of a boy, who was braver and more fearless than anyone else.</p>

            <p>"Your Majesty said that I abandoned my post as governor. However, that is not true. And another thing, the one leading the gladiators is not me, it's—"</p>

            <p>"Not you?"</p>

            <p>"—Your Majesty's own son."</p>

            <p>Gustav would never forget Vincent's reaction at that moment for the rest of his life.</p>

            <p>"……"</p>

            <p>For a moment, Vincent's piercing, black eyes widened, his usually sharp face slackening with surprise.</p>

            <p>The only way to describe his reaction was someone piercing through to the truth. The expression caused by both the speaker and contents of the speech being completely unexpected to Vincent.</p>

            <p>For an instant, his surprise was plain on his face. He immediately covered his mouth with his hand and erased it.</p>

            <p>"I had admired your dedication to your duty, with no room for leisure."</p>

            <p>"I share the same sentiment. However, if things had continued as Your Majesty and I had thought, I would've been left watching the Empire's crisis unfold from the westernmost point."</p>

            <p>Had Schwartz not undertaken the radical action of occupying "Gladiator Island", Gustav would have remained on the island, even during this major crisis of the Empire, and would have been immersed in the role of managing the gladiators.</p>

            <p>Even if something were to happen to Vincent in the capital, he would have been obedient to his assigned duties. He must have thought of his unnoticed achievements as his parting gift.</p>

            <p>He feels a profound sense of relief from the fact that he didn't have to leave it that way, and that such a version of him did not remain.</p>

            <p>This was the result of Schwartz persuading him, and the Emperor interpreting his orders at his own discretion—specifically in case of an "emergency", and it was splurging a self-judgment to its worst in hauling himself to the imperial capital.
            
            "Even if they killed the Emperor with the imperial city, it would have been a good use of you all."</p>

            <p>"The Emperor?"</p>

            <p>Contrary to Gustav who thought that he could affirm himself, regardless of whether his judgement was correct, the words spilled out by Vincent implied a different speculation. However, Vincent did not try to touch upon the dripping speculation. Instead, shaking his head, Vincent said,
            
            "Alright, I'll bite your bait. You should win your own retreat and the amnesty of the 'Gladiators' in this state of survival crisis of this empire- step down."</p>

            <p>"Yes. I will do my best to the limit of my main profession."
            
            Between Gustav and Vincent, an agreement is reached regarding handling of the "emergency". Whether Gustav, the governor of the "Gladiator Island," did something that strays from his duty, his self and the activity of the Pleiades Battalion from here on will prove that.
            
            There is no certainty that it can be done. But at this point, Gustav thought that at least he didn't regret Schwartz's instigation.
            
            Right, when Gustav with a slightly twisted mouth was about to leave the Emperor,
            
            "May I ask the Emperor a question…?"</p>

            <p>Gustav unexpectedly gasped at Idra, who suddenly started speaking, while he was still bowing down.
            
            In a trembling voice, Idra, who dared to say such a thing to Vincent, skillfully raised his head, and his eyes, which could well be teary, were directed towards the Emperor. Idra's courage in showing guts even during "Sparka" on the island is admirable, but insisting in front of the Emperor is an extremely egregious act that certainly does not involve fear for his life.
            
            But---
            
            "What is it?"</p>

            <p>At the unexpected response from Vincent, Gustav is once again surprised.
            
            In that gap, the advantage-seeking Idra, reminiscent of the Gladiator, employed his last-ditch intuition and asked the anticipated question with dry lips.</p>

            <p>That is---
            
            "After this battle, what do you plan to do with your son... Prince Schwartz?"</p>

            <p>"Missanga!?</p>

            <p>It was an inappropriate and badly timed question that only the bravest in the empire would dare to ask. The rumors of the "Black Hair Prince" that had spread throughout varied places were inseparable from the great civil war in the history of the Empire, a war that altered the state of affairs between the living and the dead. The Pleiades Battalion was initially established due to the tense confrontation between Schwartz and Vincent. As such, the primary goal of the Battalion was tied to them. It was only natural that Idra sought the answer from Vincent.</p>

            <p>The problem was Idra was, due to his tension, oblivious to the fact that it was the ultimate form of disrespect that could endanger his life.</p>

            <p>"------"</p>

            <p>In response to the silence that ensued, Gustav grew aware of an unusual agitation. Looking back, the distress he had experienced recently stemmed from either Schwartz or Cecilus—this is the first time that Idra has entered the equation, a development that made the world seem transient. So intense was this realization that Gustav was almost tempted to escape from the situation in front of him—soon,</p>

            <p>"------Idra Missanga"</p>

            <p>Vincent called Idra's name with his lips. Not only Idra but also Gustav widened his eyes, swallowing his saliva at this. In front of them, Emperor Vincent recrossed his long legs and continued.</p>

            <p>"The matter of the advancement or retreat is not within my control"</p>

            <p>Vincent's response didn't make any sense. It was inconceivable that Vincent, the one on top of this empire, did not possess the right to decide on Schwartz's advancement or retreat. However, they couldn't let Idra press the issue any further.</p>

            <p>"While your head and body are connected, you should back down.------Anything more would be disrespectful"</p>

            <p>With the line drawn by the Emperor, who suggested he would overlook this much, Gustav quickly pulled Idra to his feet. With two arms, he picked Idra up and clamped his mouth shut with the remaining two. Most likely, given the luck that he was having that night, Idra was possibly the most fortunate in the fortress city, or even in the empire. In that state holding up highly fortunate Idra, Gustav deeply bowed towards Vincent.</p>

            <p>And then...,</p>

            <p>"Your Highness Schwartz, please be lenient".</p>

            <p>Making use of Idra's luck, Gustav made his plea and brought the curtain down on the explanation scene in the "fortress of the lone sword", to depart.</p>

            <p>"Gustav Morello making such statements... always an unpredictable man," murmured Vincent Vollachia, watching Gustav depart with the guilty Idra under his arm, after dropping unsolicited words.</p>

            <p>The reality that he'd unexpectedly been whisked away to the "Gladiator Island", persuaded the swordsmen there and even swayed the stubborn Gustav, who was dedicated to his duty, was awe-inspiring enough to make it seem inconsistent that he wasn’t a "Stargazer".</p>

            <p>However...</p>

            <p>"Even if they contribute to the city's defenses, it's far from solid. We cannot ignore the selection of attacking forces to the capital city", Vincent pondered silently.</p>

            <p>He had much to think about regarding how to act next, delegates from their allied Kingdom weren’t his only concern. Leaving Berstetz and Serena at the fortress city, and with Goz in charge of the troops, things should function.</p>

            <p>There was a painful deficiency in simple combative resources for the assault team, but...</p>

            <p>"Irreplaceable are the people skilled in large-scale warfare. In that respect, Cecilus is worth more than ten men... Not that I'd want ten of him, a nightmare indeed. I wonder if his delay in joining us is because he's seen something of interest in the capital. I'd prefer to avoid our country being destroyed," he muttered to himself.</p>

            <p>The risks of "The Stone", Cecilus' massacre of the undead, and drain on the Great Spirit's mana were concerns shared by all those acquainted with Cecilus' temperament.</p>

            <p>Like Halibel restraining the Black Dragon from the chain of carriages, even with his dwindled physicality, it was unlikely Cecilus would lag behind the undead. But the problem lay in him not being behind.</p>

            <p>"If the country falls because of this, the blame will lie on the day Chisha picked up…that. It might be satisfying that his calculation failed but..." Vincent said to himself. He wasn't insane enough to find pleasure in such a calamity, and many doubts still lingered.</p>

            <p>As Vincent re-adjusted his focus thus,</p>

            <p>"Wait, hold on! They told me not to let you in, Your Highness!"</p>

            <p>"Like I said! I haven’t even said it’s okay yet!"</p>

            <p>The sudden outburst of voices broke his thoughts. The loud, quarrelsome voices high in pitch in front of Vincent who had just raised his head, caused the door to his room to be burst open with great force.</p>

            <p>"Abel, lend me your face!"</p>

            <p>"I refuse."</p>

            <p>Bursting through the door with such force it might as well have been broken down was a tall woman with her long, blonde hair flailing about. This was Medium O'Connell, who unashamedly stepped before the emperor with her twin savage swords strapped to her waist and irresponsibly carried out her outrageous act. Behind Medium, Jamal O'Reilly, who was previously standing at the door, peeked out with a pathetic look on his face.</p>

            <p>This was met with a cold stare from Vincent.</p>

            <p>"I recall ordering that only permitted individuals were allowed entry, did I not?"</p>

            <p>"Yes, yes you did sir... but when Her Highness the Empress wants to come in, I... well, I simply don't know what to do..."</p>

            <p>"Then, if a 'General' higher in rank than you were to appear with the intention of treason, would you be helpless?"</p>

            <p>"Yes! No! If it were between you and a 'General', sir, I'd always consider you higher ranking. But with Her Highness, I... well, I simply don't know where she stands...!"</p>

            <p>Jamal managed to carefully select his words despite his blatant roughness. Accepting this response, Vincent cut the conversation short and turned his attention to the defiantly standing Medium. The entrance of Medium, who was visibly agitated, was quite different from what he had heard.</p>

            <p>"I heard you were holed up in your room, crying like a baby."</p>

            <p>"Who said that? That's so unlike me! Sure, I... well, I might have cried a bit...!"</p>

            <p>"Your brother, Flop O'Connell, said it."</p>

            <p>"Big Bro! Big Bro! Why would you say such a thing?!"</p>

            <p>"Why, it's simple, my dear sister. Of course, it was to encourage Emperor Vincent here to take a stronger interest in Medium and feel more protective of her in the upcoming queen contest!"</p>

            <p>Medium, who had whirled around with great momentum, had been told this by Flop. His confession about his scheme was so frank it was humorous.</p>

            <p>Flop seemed indifferent to Jamal, who had let him slip by. Yet, there was no time for a sibling squabble.</p>

            <p>"I told you, Jamal! I'm not okay with it! I don't hate Abel but I don't even know what being an empress entails!"</p>

            <p>"I see, I see. But, sister, did you know exactly what a sister is supposed to do when you became one? Didn't you become one without knowing anything... or am I wrong?"</p>

            <p>"Eh? Now that you mention it, that might be the case..."</p>

            <p>"Well then, whether or not you know something isn't important when it comes to becoming something. What's crucial is the desire to become and your environment. Both a Princess and an Empress are the same at their roots!"
            
            "Wow! You're brilliant, Bro! Are you trying to fool us, Bro!?"</p>

            <p>Caught by the fierce reaction of Medium, Flop placed his hand on his forehead with a frustrated face, saying "I guess that won't work then."
            
            Seems like this won't spark a sibling fight after all.</p>

            <p>"Don't come before me with a discussion that you two couldn't settle. I'm busy. Jamal, take them out."
            
            "Ah, wait, wait! Whether I am the Empress or not doesn't matter right now! I didn't want to use Abel's face for that reason..."
            
            "What is it then?"
            
            "I want to be taken to the imperial city too!"
            
            With a loud thud, Medium demanded exactly this, hitting her own chest with her hand.
            
            At that request, Vincent frowned. Then, the brave-faced Medium stood next to him, and Flop raised his finger and said, "We might have surprised you with this sudden situation, but it's not just a whim that my sister said this. It's something we saw at the last moment in that dragon carriage before we arrived at this city..."
            
            "--- Balleroy Temeglyph, is it?"
            
            "Yes, that's right."
            
            Vincent comes up with the last defense of the chain dragon carriage in response to Flop's acknowledgement without any surprise. Subaru had forced the girl he started to call Spica to do something, as a result, the resurrection of the dead girl Lamia was incomplete where Vincent unleashed his blade. Balleroy Temeglyph, the "Magical Sharpshooter" who rode a dead flying dragon, had taken away his sister who was dying again.
            
            Seeing Balleroy there, Medium did indeed speak. "Big Brother Ball..."
            
            The faint whispers of the frail Medium. She screamed with a flipped voice, calling out to the retreating Balleroy.
            
            "Medium and I have known Balleroy for a long time. We were previously under the service of the upper class Dracroy Lord. We met Balleroy there... I would never have thought that we would meet again in that kind of situation."
            
            "Calling that a reunion is a bit of an irony," Vincent replied.
            
            Upon hearing Vincent's words, Flop, unusually downcast, responded with, "That's true."</p>

            <p>The complex emotions that Medium and Flop had for the undead Balleroy, if someone close to you had appeared drastically changed from their living form, it's understandable to feel heartache. However--</p>

            <p>"------"</p>

            <p>Vincent had more than enough understanding of their emotions, however he dared not say it out loud. At the very least, he gave last rites to his own revived sister with his own hands.</p>

            <p>"So, how are the connections between you siblings and Balleroy related to your previous request?"</p>

            <p>"Abel, you're smart, you must understand what I'm trying to say, right? Even though you do, the way you phrase things gives off a very uncool vibe so you should stop it."</p>

            <p>"------"</p>

            <p>"I want to meet and talk with big brother Balleroy. Even if he's like that and I completely don't understand what he's thinking, I want to talk. Because"</p>

            <p>At first Medium spoke with momentum, but slowly her words became hesitant and she chose her words carefully, trying to convey the feelings in her chest. That's when Medium paused her words once.</p>

            <p>So she could select the most important words in the most accurate way, she pondered seriously,</p>

            <p>"That's because I wanted to become big brother Balleroy's bride."</p>

            <p>"----. Purely emotional it seems"</p>

            <p>Answering Medium's teary appeal, Vincent turned his gaze to Flop. Even now Medium looked like she could burst into tears, Flop was the one who recommended making her one of his wives. His true intention should be less of ambition and more of concern for Medium's wellbeing.</p>

            <p>"Are you fine with not stopping your little sister who is heading towards certain death?"</p>

            <p>"My, my, Emperor, it seems you don't understand how much my sister and I value dialogue. Of course, I tried to stop her repeatedly before coming here, and I just finished rebandaging from when she shook me off with force!"</p>

            <p>"In short, she pushed you aside with force. It's surprising she can ignore her older brother's advice."</p>

            <p>"I love my 'anchan', and what 'anchan' says is usually correct. But, because 'anchan' and I are different people, there are times where I want to do something different. Now is one of those times."</p>

            <p>Medium regained her strength in her voice saying that neither strength nor words could stop her.</p>

            <p>At her powerful plea, Vincent took a while to think.</p>

            <p>In simple terms of strength, Medium's capability is barely above that of an empire soldier.</p>

            <p>"Jamal, who can't even keep simple directions, likely surpasses me in swordsmanship. I can hardly see he would make a dramatic contribution to the state of war if I brought him along. However, that rather implies her presence won't affect the battle."</p>

            <p>"Do as you like."</p>

            <p>"Really!? Abel, is that alright?"</p>

            <p>"Don't be suspicious because your request was granted. Your presence or absence won't affect the war. However, you will bear the burden because of that."</p>

            <p>"You mean..."</p>

            <p>Medium, surprised by his response, blinked at Vincent's subsequent words. Flop interrupts, adding, "Basically,"</p>

            <p>"You must protect yourself. There's no extra capacity to protect Medium."</p>

            <p>"That's right. Without that commitment, plunging into the fray is..."</p>

            <p>"Well, then, I'm okay! I've always had to defend myself during our travels with my brother."</p>

            <p>"..."</p>

            <p>Medium herself dashed Vincent's intent to tell her that if she intended to be protected for being a candidate for Empress, she was mistaken. Medium, who seemed nervous about what she would be told, sighed with relief as if presented with light conditions.</p>

            <p>"Oh, I was so nervous about what I was going to be told. But, I'm glad Abel wasn't as mean as I feared."</p>

            <p>Having been told almost exactly what he was thinking, Vincent's lips formed a slight grimace. Either way, Medium vocalized her demands and declared acceptance of the risks involved. Therefore, there was nothing more Vincent needed to add.</p>

            <p>"Tomorrow morning"</p>

            <p>"Eh?"</p>

            <p>"Tomorrow morning, we'll head to the imperial capital with the selected personnel. Get ready."</p>

            <p>With a quick announcement, Vincent then looked in Flop's direction.</p>

            <p>"I hope you're not saying you also want to come along? I have no intention of discussing whether or not suicidal people who can't protect themselves should be allowed."</p>

            <p>"Thanks for your concern. I certainly don't intend to die willingly. I also don't want to be a hindrance to my sister. I'll leave Balleroy's matter to Medium."</p>

            <p>"Brother…"</p>

            <p>"…Not that there's any guarantee we'll meet."</p>

            <p>Vincent made no comment on Flop's decision, merely acknowledging the possibility that it might not bear fruit. However, upon hearing Vincent's words, Flop donned a grin.</p>

            <p>"It's alright, I'm sure it will happen."</p>

            <p>"Why do you think so?"</p>

            <p>"I believe in fate. It can be cruel, but it isn't supposed to be tasteless."</p>

            <p>Such a baseless statement held a persuasive power no different from Medium's emotional argument. However, Vincent refrained from mentioning it further because he believed that if he were to say anything more, the siblings would undoubtedly retaliate.</p>

            <p>Besides, they must know it too, even without him mentioning it.</p>

            <p>"Well then, Abel, see you tomorrow! You better sleep well, or you'll have dark circles!"</p>

            <p>Waving her hand vigorously, Medium confidently turned her back on them. The scar left by her teary eyes was not seen on her upright back. If she wasn't fake crying, she must be a girl with rapid changes in emotions.</p>

            <p>Following Medium out, Flop who was supposed to be behind her paused,</p>

            <p>"Thank you, Emperor."</p>

            <p>"For what?"</p>

            <p>"For empathizing with Medium's... no, our feelings. And, for not condemning Medium for loving Balleroy despite being a potential queen candidate."</p>

            <p>Lowering the corners of his eyes, Flop said this as he rubbed his own head. Therefore, Vincent snorted in response to what Flop was saying, acknowledging Medium's desire to meet Balleroy, and the gratitude for not condemning that.</p>

            <p>"Punish love? Such tasteless act, the one who does that will be miserable."</p>

            <p>Upon hearing his answer, Flop grinned gleefully which was irksome to Vincent.</p>
