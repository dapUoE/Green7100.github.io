        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>"His Excellency, Emperor Vincent Vollachia," said Flop, looking at him with a grave face. At this, Vincent squinted one eye.</p>

            <p>Flop and Medium, who had imprisoned Vincent in a chamber of the chained dragon carriage, did not seem to comprehend the gravity of what they had done. They were beautiful blonde siblings who had committed an act that would warrant capital punishment if discovered - all for the mere purpose of relaying a message from another person.</p>

            <p>And after all that-</p>

            <p>"May I share a bit of a story with you before delivering the message?"</p>

            <p>With a serious face, he asked if he could digress into a tale.</p>

            <p>"-------"</p>

            <p>Unable to gauge what was going on in Flop's mind, Vincent remained silent, his one eye still squinted. Perhaps interpreting the silence as a favorable wind blowing his way, Flop added,</p>

            <p>"I know it's presumptuous of me... but after you've heard the message, would you honor a request of mine?"</p>

            <p>"What?"</p>

            <p>"My, my, aren't we in a frightful mood, Your Excellency! But remember, I am the only one privy to the message you must hear, so you can't afford to silence me rashly."</p>

            <p>"I could command Olbart Dunkelkenn to interrogate you using Shinobi torture and make you spill the beans."</p>

            <p>"Wouldn't it be better if we talked peaceably, Your Excellency!"</p>

            <p>At Vincent's veiled threats, Flop quickly raised his hands. The audacity to negotiate against an Emperor was beyond a simple show of courage. That being said, the prelude to his story and strange request must be of great importance to him.</p>

            <p>However---</p>

            <p>"But big bro, isn't our time here limited? If we carry on like this, Goz Chin and the others might worry that Abel isn't coming back, right? A story is one thing, but what about your request?"</p>

            <p>Medium, tilting her head in query, obviously hadn't been clued in by her brother.</p>

            <p>"You foolish girl. Don't blindly go along with your brother's reckless actions without understanding them."</p>

            <p>"Huh? But whatever my brother does right? I will help with anything. It's a vow to our family. Right, Abel?"</p>

            <p>"What an idiot. Are you ignorant of how one becomes the Emperor of Vollachia?"</p>

            <p>Vincent blinked at the nonchalance with which Medium spouted her nonsense. He saw real shock in her response and glared at Flop in disbelief. Saying utter nonsense has its limits too.</p>

            <p>The tale of Vollachia's royal siblings murdering each other to determine the next Emperor was gruesome, but it was common knowledge.</p>

            <p>For Medium, who didn't even know this, Vincent questioned Flop's biased education.</p>

            <p>Yet, to Vincent's gaze, Flop inexplicably smiled,</p>

            <p>"I understand your gaze, Your Imperial Majesty. Are you surprised that my sister is nonsensical?" Flop asked.
                
            "Who wouldn't be? Also, stop using the formal title 'Your Imperial Excellency' every time. If there's no one else it could refer to, just 'Your Excellency' is fine."</p>

            <p>"I see, I understand, Your Imperial Excellency-kun."</p>

            <p>"-------"</p>

            <p>Still smiling, Flop nodded and Vincent narrowed his eyes at his continued casual behavior.</p>

            <p>The serious look from before and the impression that Flop wanted to show the face behind the title, were certainly felt again now.</p>

            <p>A clear sign that Flop had some thoughts and feelings towards Vincent.</p>

            <p>"Sister, you asked me why I was telling old stories. It's because there's a connection between our past and His Imperial Excellency-kun."</p>

            <p>"Eh!? Really? There's a connection between us and Abel?! What?!"</p>

            <p>"Hahaha, goodness, sister, you're incredibly forgetful. His Imperial Excellency-kun is the Emperor of the Empire. That means he also has a connection with the 'Nine Divine Generals'---"</p>

            <p>"-- You're talking about Bal-brother?"</p>

            <p>Medium, who had wide eyes of surprise, suddenly lost her liveliness.</p>

            <p>The name she uttered and the term "Nine Divine Generals' spoken just before. Linking the two, Vincent naturally discerned one name.</p>

            <p>"Are you, affiliated with Balleroy Temeglyph?"</p>

            <p>"Yes, that's right, Your Imperial Excellency-kun. We're what you'd call sworn siblings. Spent the most susceptible part of our lives together, dear, cherished family!"</p>

            <p>With this, Flop clenched his fist and raised his voice. Meanwhile, Vincent merely sighed.</p>

            <p>Medium lowered her eyebrow corners, glancing back and forth between her brother and Vincent. From her expression emerged clear confusion and a tinge of sorrow.</p>

            <p>"This carriage, it seems that Lady Selena Dracoy is on board with us," the brother casually mentioned. "Funny thing, my sister and I were also once under the care of the Dracoy family."</p>

            <p>"Selena-nee..." The sister chimed in softly.</p>

            <p>"As for that name, it was a title mandated by the Dracoy family so as not to be treated as a stranger by Medium or mistakenly treated as an older woman than her actual age. Fascinating, isn't it?"</p>

            <p>Without any intention of dwelling on the subject further, the speaker shifted. "Let's get to the point."</p>

            <p>Distracting with irrelevant topics is a known tactic of peddlers. The relationship between this brother and sister with Selena, and their connection to Balleroy, was something he had predicted when they revealed their association.</p>

            <p>To elaborate, Balleroy Temeglyph was originally under Serena Dracoy's command and was promoted to "The Nine Divine Generals" due to his remarkable skills-- a promising "General" indeed.</p>

            <p>However, knowing the fate of Balleroy, many soldiers' gaze would turn to disappointment. His disastrous death, having incited a rebellion against the emperor that led to failure, was the final page of Balleroy's story, the man these two called family, which would likely be recorded in historical documents.</p>

            <p>"No..."</p>

            <p>Or perhaps due to his resurrection as an undead, the description of Balleroy Temeglyph left in the history books may not be of rebellion, but of a being that brought about the Empire's demise.</p>

            <p>Realizing this, Vincent decided not to share this with Flop and his sister. Bringing up the undead Balleroy's story would only divert the conversation from the information Vincent was seeking.</p>

            <p>Regardless...</p>

            <p>"That's right, let's get to the main point. The old story isn't that long. The essentials have been, inadvertently, mentioned by Medium." Making a small downward motion with his eyebrows, Flop slowly shook his head.</p>

            <p>Medium wore an expression of non-recognition at his words, but Vincent made no comment. He thought the off-track conversation of the siblings should only be corrected when they stray too far off-topic.</p>

            <p>"We, Medium and I, were orphans raised under horrific conditions in an institution. We were rescued and taken to Dracoy's territory... That's where we met Balleroy and became sibling-like. Is that clear up to here?"</p>

            <p>"---Please continue," came the curt response.</p>

            <p>"Those were busy days. Medium and I were so ignorant of the outside world that everything we saw was fresh and new. The Lady Dracoy is an individual of broad vision, so she allowed even children with no place to go like us to receive an education."</p>

            <p>"Despite that, progress hasn't been made on your sister's end," said Vincent.</p>

            <p>"I just... prefer moving around with Bal and everyone..." replied Medium, her lips puckering slightly as she regained a bit of her usual tone.</p>

            <p>The nature of the Dracoy territory that Flop spoke of was something that Vincent too was aware of, and incidentally, he considered their way of managing the domain to be highly commendable.</p>

            <p>The "Scorching Duke" was frequently revered for her rugged vigor, but the true strength of Selena Dracoy came from her ability to think outside the box, uninhibited by established concepts.</p>

            <p>Mostly, in the Vollachian Empire, there was no such thing as a long-term perspective; The majority of children weren't expected to be a labor or military force, so many were born, and out of them, only those blessed with the strength and environment to survive managed to do so, with an exceedingly small number reaching great heights.</p>

            <p>In this nation where attempts to teach and nurture a wide range of talents from childhood, unless they're one's own family, is mostly dismissed as idle chatter, Flop and Medium were siblings gifted with rare opportunities. Or rather, Balleroy, whose talent was recognized, was probably one of them.</p>

            <p>"Of course, it wasn't always fun, and Lord Dracoy wasn't always kind to us. Back then, Lord Dracoy herself was very busy as he had just usurped her father's territory," Medium reminisced.</p>

            <p>"We also had our share of close calls," Flop recalled.</p>

            <p>"Like when we were attacked by assassins aiming for Lord Dracoy's life. That was really tough," continued Meduim.</p>

            <p>Listening to the pair recollecting their past, Vincent was trying to discern the crux of their story. However, he quickly identified the core thread. There was a certain familiarity in the words spoken and the gaze directed, and theirs was probably no different.</p>

            <p>In other words ----,</p>

            <p>"Overcoming those days together, we, Balleroy, and our siblings shared a strong bond. Precisely because of such a relationship, there's something I want to ask you, Emperor."</p>

            <p>"------"</p>

            <p>"Is it true that our sworn brother, Balleroy Temeglyph, widely known as a fool incapable of seeing the future, died a rebel... at the end of a wish unbefitting of him?"</p>

            <p>Returning tranquility to his features, Flop released these words into the air. Flop was inquiring Vincent about the death of Balleroy Temeglyph, a sworn brother to them, a traitor to the Empire, given their respective positions.
            
            It's a well-known phrase, a common gaze. It's a warrior's honor to die on the battlefield, to resist even when pierced by a sword - that's the way of the Sword Wolf. Even in the esteemed Vollachian Empire, not everyone can celebrate the death of a close person. It's only human to seek meaning, a reason in death.
            
            Therefore, it was a familiar wail to Vincent when Flop and his companions asked him here.</p>

            <p>'Why do you doubt? Do you think we cannot trust the rumours that have spread in the city, tainted with impurity?'</p>

            <p>'No, that's not it. We simply have the opportunity to speak with someone directly involved. Wouldn't it make sense to want to hear something more believable than gossip?'</p>

            <p>'The opportunity for conversation is something you both forced upon me.'</p>

            <p>To Flop who conveniently twisted the story to his favor, Vincent added. Thereupon, for a moment, he pondered unusually.</p>

            <p>The death of Balleroy Temeglyph, talked about in the town. His death, likely to be recorded in historical documents, is considered a miserable death due to the failure of his plotted rebellion. What Flop and Medium heard should be the same story, nothing more, nothing less. And Vincent does not consider restoring the honor of Balleroy after his death. A story of nothing more, nothing less; that is the reality broadcasted to the world.</p>

            <p>'I want you to answer, Emperor Vincent. If I knew that, I could pass the message to you—'</p>

            <p>'I don't know what you all want…'</p>

            <p>Vincent was about to answer, asserting that what the two had heard was definitely a rumour. However—</p>

            <p>'—Abel'</p>

            <p>Vincent's words were interrupted by a weak, short call.</p>

            <p>'——'</p>

            <p>Standing in front of the door of the guestroom, blocking the exit, was Medium —no, she probably didn't intend to do so anymore. Medium, standing still there, wrapped her arms around herself, and looked at Vincent with a tear-filled gaze.</p>

            <p>He's used to seeing tear-filled eyes, whether it's begging for life or pleading. Therefore, it didn't shake Vincent's heart at all. However, a moment of consideration was given to his usual calmness.</p>

            <p>"――I don't know what you both want," Vincent began to answer.</p>

            <p>But, is that really the case? He should know what they want, it should be obvious. Vincent has what they desire.</p>

            <p>He possesses it, yet refuses to speak of it. That's Vincent's way.</p>

            <p>However, that way comes with the caveat of "as always".</p>

            <p>"――――"</p>

            <p>His "as always" approach includes Vincent deciding everything based on his thoughts alone.</p>

            <p>However, with that "as always" approach, Vincent had his feet swept out from under him by a loyal vassal. His confident projection was knocked out by a man with a foolish head, revealing his guess was off-target.</p>

            <p>With this "as always" way of doing things, there were limits.</p>

            <p>What Vincent needed to do was not just the "as always," but to go "beyond" it.</p>

            <p>And to obtain that way to approach things, he had to—</p>

            <p>"—The death of Balleroy Temeglyph is not as the rumors spread among the common people. There's a different truth,"</p>

            <p>That's right, Vincent had chosen to give an answer different from his usual approach.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center">△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>"—―――"</p>

            <p>Upon hearing Vincent's response, both Flop and Medium's expressions changed.</p>

            <p>Flop widened his eyes slightly while Medium blinked in astonishment. Both appeared surprised, but the nature of their shock was distinct.</p>

            <p>Through observing their varied reactions, Vincent understood.</p>

            <p>"Flop O'Connell, you knew the truth wasn't as the rumors suggested,"</p>

            <p>"Eh... big bro?"</p>

            <p>"It's not exactly that I 'knew'. The rumors simply didn't seem like Balleroy, and I think Medium felt the same."</p>

            <p>"U-um..."</p>

            <p>Medium nodded with a baffled look, as if caught off guard by the direct question.</p>

            <p>However, Flop who had made his sister nod did not outright deny Vincent's accusation.</p>

            <p>With Vincent's gaze on him, Flop tilted his head slightly and said,</p>

            <p>"Surely, you aren't thinking that because Balleroy and I were close, he personally told me in advance, and now I'm trying to trap you?"</p>

            <p>"――. It's possible, though nearly unlikely. The man I knew would not allow even the smallest chance for error. Until the moment of execution, I believe he didn't leak a word to anyone."</p>

            <p>"...That's true. I agree with what you're saying, Emperor-sama. I'm glad. It seems that, I can discuss the familiar story of Balleroy with you. Because,"</p>

            <p>"-------"</p>

            <p>"Ever since that incident, hearing the name Balleroy anywhere in the Empire, it only felt like we were being told a tale about someone unknown to me and Medium."</p>

            <p>Frumbling his well-shaped eyebrows, Flop's blue eyes oscillate with isolation.</p>

            <p>It's likely true, Vincent doesn't even seem surprised.</p>

            <p>Chisha moderated the rumors to conveniently fit the narrative, Berstetz instructed so, and Vincent was the one who commanded it to be done.</p>

            <p>Everything was to cover up the true reason why Balleroy Temeglyph became a traitor.</p>

            <p>That is - -</p>

            <p>"- - That rebellion wasn't originally Balleroy's intention."</p>

            <p>"Big brother!?"</p>

            <p>Medium shrieked, sounding almost like a scream in response to Flop’s words.</p>

            <p>She opened her round eyes wide, shaking her head vigorously from side to side,</p>

            <p>"That's strange, ridiculous. Because brother Balleroy... Abel too! Say something! Tell big brother that's absurd..."</p>

            <p>“If there’s a need for correction, it's done. If not, it's not. That's all.”</p>

            <p>“There's no reason... to say anything...”</p>

            <p>Medium was dumbfounded, words failing her, a shocked expression on her face as she couldn’t comprehend the situation.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, when Flop let out a deep, long sigh, he seems to accept the fact that Vincent did not deny his suspicion about the truth behind Balleroy's death.</p>

            <p>In the street rumors, Balleroy Temeglyph was a stupid loser who died a traitor's death in his dissatisfaction with his position in the "Nine Divine Generals" and had aimed for the top.</p>

            <p>That proved the firmness of Vincent Vollachia's throne and it brought the effect of weakening the reckless fire in many ambitious people.</p>

            <p>"Ironically, I was the one who helped the rebellion, and the weakened fire was rekindled by my own plot."</p>

            <p>"- - That's right, the peace was brief. But it's probably just taking advantage of the results, it wasn't originally the whole purpose."</p>

            <p>"-------"</p>

            <p>"Balleroy had another purpose. His Majesty the emperor just took advantage of the results, the premise should be different. Does the Emperor know even that purpose?"</p>

            <p>Flop must have had plenty of time to think. That would be the reason for his forthright conversation.</p>

            <p>With the death of Balleroy, rumors that differed from the truth began to circulate, prompting Flop to constantly ponder where the truth truly lay. Thus, he seized his once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. "The Sharpshooter" Balleroy Temeglyph. His aim in participating in the rebellion was――</p>

            <p>"――To avenge the death of Corporal Miles, who was sent on a special mission to the Kingdom of Lugunica and lost his life there."</p>

            <p>"――!"</p>

            <p>"Why are you surprised, Flop O'Connell? This is a fact you should know. You've been testing the Emperor's patience. This is disrespectful."</p>

            <p>Vincent said so in response to the breathless Flop, his tone snorting. This conversation was probably another trap set by Flop for Vincent, much like when he had earlier asked about the veracity of the rumors about Balleroy. It was Flop's way of assessing whether it was worth continuing the conversation.</p>

            <p>But at Vincent's words, Flop shook his head and said, "No". He wore an expression of surprise, specifically one blending two kinds of shock.</p>

            <p>"I won't shamely deny it. Yes, I was testing you. But―"</p>

            <p>"What?"</p>

            <p>"…Your answer, and the mention of Corporal Miles' name shocked me,.”</p>

            <p>"………"</p>

            <p>To the surprised tones in Flop’s voice, Vincent narrowed his eyes. Even ignoring the former’s testing response, the latter was not surprising. He knew of Corporal Miles, who was deeply involved with Balleroy ― no, not just Miles.</p>

            <p>"It's natural to understand the names, appearances, and positions of those who serve me. What do you think a commander would be betting his entire spirit on?"</p>

            <p>Even if not for such occasions, the position of the Emperor was essentially always under threat. If you order to risk life, you should know who is on the other side. You should know in case they might come to take your life. And you mustn't forget the names of those who followed your orders and lost their lives.</p>

            <p>"I'm different from the people of the Kingdom. I don't have to be sentimental about the death of each and every soldier. I just have to remember. Hence, I remember Corporal Miles, and Balleroy Temeglyph――”</p>

            <p>"Do you remember Abel…?"</p>

            <p>"――Just that. It's not a consolation."</p>

            <p>Vincent responded so to the weak, stuttering words of Medium.</p>

            <p>"In that case," Vincent began, addressing Flop and Medium. "Even if you want to restore Balleroy's honor, that is an impossibility."</p>

            <p>"What?! Why so?" came a startled response.</p>

            <p>"Once rumors that contradict the known facts begin to circulate, there will inevitably be those who stir up further suspicion. The rise of such rumors could pose a threat to the stability of the Empire. That's something…"</p>

            <p>"Something that Balroy wouldn't want. Right?"</p>

            <p>It seemed to Flop that Vincent had understood the extent of the situation. With resignation in his eyes, Vincent tilted his head back. The intensity of the situation starts to manifest as clear distress on Medium's face.</p>

            <p>To his sister, Flop offered comforting yet stern words. "My dear sister, didn't you say it yourself? That you would do anything to help me. That's our family oath, and I can stand by that declaration with pride."</p>

            <p>"Yes, but what does that mean? What does…"</p>

            <p>"If Balroy truly planned to kill the emperor and start a rebellion, he would have asked us to assist him. Even if it just meant a slight chance of success, he would have done so if he was serious."</p>

            <p>At Flop's words, realization dawned on Medium's face.</p>

            <p>She too had previously mentioned the "family oath" — Vincent did not know how much coercive power these words had, but if it meant she would not reject an invitation to conspire against the emperor, then Flop’s explanation made sense.</p>

            <p>"Balleroy didn't really intend to carry out a successful rebellion. However, he did have a desire to avenge our elder brother, Miles. The contradiction here implies Balleroy didn't think Miles' enemy was the emperor."</p>

            <p>She fell silent.</p>

            <p>"Can I ask one more thing?" Flop had taken up more than his fair share of the time, but still, he had the audacity to raise one more question. Vincent felt weakened in the face of Flop's audacity.</p>

            <p>In the silence that followed, Flop, perhaps sensing a moment of advantage, asked, "Did Balroy manage to fulfill his dying wish, avenging Miles?"</p>

            <p>"No," fell Vincent's terse response.</p>

            <p>"I see..."</p>

            <p>And with that, Vincent offered no further information.</p>

            <p>Even if Flopp asked for it, he had no intention of giving it. Even if Flop aspired to avenge the two brothers, Balroy and Miles, it was an impossible task. Above all, it was because...</p>

            <p>"Ballroy Temeglyph wouldn't want that."</p>

            <p>△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>"Sorry for the long conversation, Your Majesty," Flop humbly said, concluding the discussion about Balleroy Temeglyph with Vincent.</p>

            <p>Indeed, it was a rather long conversation.</p>

            <p>"Do you have any idea how precious my time is during this crisis?"</p>

            <p>"I have confidence in judging the value of things. That's why I utilized the message I was entrusted with at the moment when it would be most valuable, to get the answer that my sister and I were seeking."</p>

            <p>"This isn't only disrespectful. Furthermore, don't lie to me."</p>

            <p>"Huh?"</p>

            <p>"It's not the answer you and Medium were seeking, it's the answer you were seeking. This was merely indulging your wish. Something to do with a 'family vow'," Vincent corrected Flopp, with a knife-like sharpness in his eyes.</p>

            <p>At this, both Medium and Flopp were surprised. Flopp then nodded, saying, "That's true."</p>

            <p>"I was the one who wanted to know the answer. If someone is to be beheaded, I'd prefer it were only me."</p>

            <p>"Fool. Can I really go along with your nonsense any longer? Medium, don't look at me with such eyes."</p>

            <p>Annoyed by Vincent's remark, Medium looked at him pleadingly.</p>

            <p>"So, are you satisfied now?"</p>

            <p>"Yeah, I am. I understood that despite your precious time, Your Majesty sincerely responded to me. I appreciate you not falling into the trap I kept setting," Flopp said, openly admitting that he was testing the Emperor.</p>

            <p>Vincent was left speechless. What would Flop have done if Vincent's answer had not been satisfactory?</p>

            <p>Sensing the question in Vincent's silence, Flop laughed.</p>

            <p>"If that were the case, I would have brought this message to the master instead of you, Your Excellency, seek his help to save the Empire, and probably make him the Emperor," said Flop.</p>

            <p>"You..."</p>

            <p>"Phew, I'm glad I wasn't wrong! ... You are one of the creators of the world I should take vengeance on, but not really."</p>

            <p>"Avenge the world?"</p>

            <p>With Flop's words mixed with a sigh of relief, Vincent raised an eyebrow. Then, while the emperor and his brother were talking, Medium, who was snuffling her nose, replied, "You know what,"</p>

            <p>"That's what my brother always says. It's not that there's one bad person when something unpleasant happens, it's that the world that makes that person bad is scarier~"</p>

            <p>"It's a blunt explanation, but that's what it is! Well, it's that kind of world where unpleasant things happen due to irrationality, so even small things, I diligently work towards improving them. That's my way of taking revenge on the world"</p>

            <p>"—Ridiculous."</p>

            <p>Avenging the world, and the creators of that world.</p>

            <p>Thinking that it sounds something like Cecilus Segmunt would say, Vincent muttered. At his mumble, Flop gave a bitter smile and Medium glared with red eyes saying "What is it~?"</p>

            <p>Looking at the sibling's reaction, Vincent thought it was more ridiculous in his heart. Clearly, he was the one who shaped the world where Flop feels the absurdity. Even if he had a reason to think about reform, if he couldn't do it, it wouldn't change that he was a target for revenge.</p>

            <p>He couldn't understand why they exempted him.</p>

            <p>No way did they stop the "usual way" because of who's thoughts they referred to when aiming for "more than usual." He didn't want to think about it.</p>

            <p>More than that—</p>

            <p>"You said it yourself. If I didn't meet your expectations, you would pass on the message to someone else and remove the crisis of the Empire with that."</p>

            <p>"Huh? That's right. I was planning to leave it to my master."</p>

            <p>"It doesn’t matter who you entrust it to. Rather, if you can remove the "Great Disaster" by entrusting it to him, it must be a serious move."</p>

            <p>It's a move that Chisha, who plotted something against Vincent, must have left behind.</p>

            <p>What exactly is it?</p>

            <p>"Tell me every single word, without omission. Assume that one dropped phrase can change the fate of the Empire."</p>

            <p>"Though I intended to do that from the beginning, it's quite scary! I received three messages in total...ahem ahem. Cheer for me so I can do well, little sister."</p>

            <p>"Yeah! Leave it to me, big bro! I can do it!"</p>

            <p>Hearing Vincent's intimidating words, Flop was fired up, and Medium chimed in with enthusiastic encouragement.
            
            Facing Vincent's intimidation, Flop cleared his throat nervously, "Firstly... regarding Cecilus Segmunt... He copied Olbart Dunkelkenn's technique, infantilized him and threw him into the lonely island of the swordsmen. Probably, he will crawl out on his own, but if he seems to be late, it might be good to tell him to stay there."</p>

            <p>"..."</p>

            <p>"No, when he was talking in front of me, he looked identical to Emperor His Majesty. His way of speaking and tone were also the same. But, this is exactly how he said it."
            As Vincent narrowed his black pupils, Flop hurriedly added on.</p>

            <p>But, there was no need for explanations. In fact, since Chisha overthrew Vincent from the throne, it was an indisputable fact that Chisha posed and acted as the Emperor. Chisha, being cautious, probably never returned to his original appearance, and even his tone of voice would remain imitated from Vincent till the very last moment.</p>

            <p>When they witnessed Cecilus, who seemed to have been infantilized, in the imperial city, they mostly assumed that Chisha was behind it. His purpose of expelling Vincent from the throne was clear when considering Cecilus being in the way.</p>

            <p>"Irrefutable that it was Chisha. If Cecilus was in the imperial city as usual, no matter what was arranged, it would not have been possible to budge him from the throne,"</p>

            <p>In other words, the truth was that he was shrunk and expelled because he was a hindrance to the plan. If the opponent is Chisha, it's understandable for Cecilus to be off guard and shrunken.</p>

            <p>"No objections. Keep going."</p>

            <p>"Then, secondly... The Sanctuary has been left in the fortress city. Depending on its presence or absence, we may learn about the Great Calamity that could lead to the fall of the Empire."</p>

            <p>"..."</p>

            <p>"Honestly, this seems quite significant, but I don't understand the detailed meaning. It wasn't the kind of atmosphere where I could ask about it either,"</p>

            <p>With a lack of confidence, Flop got these words out, his breath hitching. The reason was due to Vincent's expression, the transformation he observed after hearing the message just now.</p>

            <p>Vincent clutched his jaw tight, with a hand on his mouth to maintain silence. His eyes didn't close simultaneously. That's why, only his right eye was tightly shut.The reason they aimed for the fortress city of Garkla was because they believed that Chisha must have left some kind of countermeasure there. But it wasn't the case. What Chisha Gold left in the fortress city was not a countermeasure, but "the answer".</p>

            <p>"We need to enter the fortress city as soon as possible."</p>

            <p>"Hold on, hold on, Abel! There were three messages, right? There's still one left!"</p>

            <p>Medium stops Vincent who was in a hurry to reach the door. At her words, he stopped and let out a deep sigh. He wondered what the third message was--the first was about Cecilus, the second was "the answer."</p>

            <p>"Tell me. If you still have some cards up your sleeve..."</p>

            <p>He would make use of that as well, to protect the Vollachian Empire from "the Great Disaster."</p>

            <p>Flop, looking back at Vincent's pleading black eyes, prepared to convey the message entrusted to him and cleared his throat again.</p>

            <p>"Your Excellency..."</p>

            <p>The assistant paused.</p>

            <p>"The favor of removing our wheel, is here."</p>

            <p>After a moment's silence...</p>

            <p>Vincent muttered "You bloody fool." and headed towards the cabin door.</p>

            <p>Just then, a voice called to him, "Wait a moment!" It was Flop, abandoning his facade.</p>

            <p>"Even if you rush out of the room, the speed at which we reach Garkla won't change! Unless you can run faster than a wyrm, Emperor!"</p>

            <p>"I must hurry to the fortress city. If necessary, I'll fly there on a dragon ship."</p>

            <p>"The skies aren't guaranteed to be safe! There could be dead flying dragons out there! And there's still one more story...Medium!"</p>

            <p>"Uh, okay! I got it, big brother!"</p>

            <p>Desperate to reach the fortress city, Vincent was being held back by Flop who pointed out the danger of the dragon ship from a logical perspective. He ordered Medium to obstruct Vincent's path once again.</p>

            <p>"There's no harm in hurrying to speed up the dragon carriage, or in sharing information with Berstetz. If you're going to stand in my way, I'll execute you."</p>

            <p>"Big brother, Abel's eyes are serious!"</p>

            <p>"But we're just as serious about living! Emperor! I told you at the beginning. After you hear the message, I want you to hear a favor."</p>

            <p>Vincent was silent.</p>

            <p>Carrying a restless sentiment within him, Vincent turned towards Flop, who had positioned himself between him and Medium. Undoubtedly, it was Flop who had dared to thrust upon him two conditions, one being an old tale and the other being a favor.</p>

            <p>"I don't recall agreeing," Vincent thought, "but I also didn't outright refuse, as I was interested in hearing the message."</p>

            <p>"Well then, say it," Vincent allowed. He had already made it known that it was impossible to restore Balleroy's honor. As for anything else that Flop and Medium might hope for, Vincent couldn't think of a single thing that could be achieved.</p>

            <p>"If it's too absurd or hard to accept, then it can't be helped," Flop reasoned.</p>

            <p>"Your Excellency, after this crisis is over, will you return to your throne as the Emperor of Vollachia and strive to restore, no, improve the Empire?" Flop asked.</p>

            <p>"I have some thoughts about your choice of words, but in essence, that's my plan," Vincent agreed, although he had some plans of his own. Yet due to Chisha's maneuver, whether his plans could be executed was a matter of consideration.</p>

            <p>Seeing no room for rejection, Vincent nodded in agreement. Satisfied, Flop beamed, then made an unforeseen proposal.</p>

            <p>"So, after everything ends, it's believed that you, Your Excellency, will take many wives. Would you consider making Medium one of them?"</p>

            <p>"Huh?" Medium was dumbfounded, to which Vincent simply responded, "Well, is that so? I have no objections."</p>

            <p>"Huh?" Medium voiced her surprise again.</p>

            <p>Vincent had chosen to remain unwed in order to reduce unnecessary troubles that could compromise his initial plans. However, if his plan had to be abandoned, he saw no reason to strictly adhere to this rule. He even saw a need to amend the "Imperial Selecting Rite".</p>

            <p>Hence, as the Emperor of Vollachia, it was simply fulfilling his duty.</p>

            <p>Upon hearing this, Flop breathed a sigh of relief, leaving a puzzled Medium as the only one still grappling with the surprising turn of the conversation.</p>

            <p>"Huh?" she continued to question, head tilted in confusion.</p>
