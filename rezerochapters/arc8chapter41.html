        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>Groovy Gumlet had no interest in "Stargazing"—it wasn't a matter of dislike or enmity that spurred his indifference, but rather a lack of concern in the truest sense. One seldom came into contact with those who spouted such ludicrous prophecies as "Stargazing" in ordinary life. Though as a "General," he occasionally crossed paths with Ubilk, who had permission to enter and exit the castle, Ubilk seldom spoke with anyone he didn’t need to.</p>

            <p>Groovy recalled he had hardly spoken to Ubilk except to silence him when he disrupted meetings.</p>

            <p>Therefore, he found it puzzling that Emperor Vincent and his close confidant Chisha paid such close attention to the movements of the "Stargazers." The stance of Prime Minister Berstetz toward the "Stargazers" was unclear, but as far as Groovy could tell, Berstetz's loyalty to the empire was genuine, and any complex anger he harbored toward Vincent did not seem to impact his judgment.</p>

            <p>Thus, there was no reason for Groovy, who had little to do with the empire's leadership, to take an interest in the "Stargazers." Had he known that the "Stargazers" were aware of the impending "Great Disaster" that would threaten the very existence of the empire, his mouth might have overflowed with his usual curses.</p>

            <p>But at least in this moment, the familiar curses that flew from Groovy’s mouth were not because of any anger toward the "Stargazers".</p>

            <p>"Damn it all!"</p>

            <p>As he reached out to pluck at the grey thorns that had surfaced above his left chest, they slipped through his fingers. The moment they did, he felt a sharp pain piercing his heart like a thorn, causing the beastly fur of Groovy to bristle.</p>

            <p>The sensation of being stabbed by a sharp object in one's insides, a vital point directly tied to life itself, was a pain that not even a seasoned warrior could mask.</p>

            <p>How annoying it was that the thorns had no physical form. They could not be swept away.</p>

            <p>Grinding his back teeth in pain from the one-sided assault, Groovy looked closely beside him—at the man in an iron helmet to whom he clung at the waist.</p>

            <p>Naturally, afflicted by the same curse, the man was also writhing in agony.</p>

            <p>"Damn it, get back! This mess is only going to get worse!"</p>

            <p>"Get back… ugh!"</p>

            <p>Groovy punched the slow-reacting man, Al, in the stomach to force him to retreat. As Al groaned and fell backward into the street, Groovy grabbed him and quickly pulled him into the shadow of a nearby building.</p>

            <p>It was an indiscriminate area attack. Hiding in the streets was merely a consolation.</p>

            <p>"Still, we’d like to avoid being spotted while making a racket, attracting a swarm of the living dead."</p>

            <p>"...You're not getting hit by these damn thorns?"</p>

            <p>"No? I am, certainly. If only the vines came with flowers too, it would've been quite the decorative gift, quite literally."</p>

            <p>Groovy and the others, on the same street where Cecilus landed, watched as he patted his left chest and said so.</p>

            <p>Indeed, the same thorns that tormented Groovy were translucent on his chest, and presumably, the pain was just as real. Nevertheless, Cecilus grinned through the pain, a discomfort that would've made even Groovy grimace.</p>

            <p>"The performance of a star actor must always capture the audience's attention. If an anguished expression is due to losing a loved one or a dear friend, it can indeed move people. But if you distort your face just because you're in pain, it only ruins the actor's stature."</p>

            <p>"So no matter how damn painful or torturous it is, you never lose face. That’s your damn foolish resolve, isn't it?"</p>

            <p>"Oh? Did I have this conversation with you previously?"</p>

            <p>"You did, damn it."</p>

            <p>Cecilus cocked his head. Although many did not lend an ear to Cecilus's nonsense, Groovy found it troublesome that despite his disinterest, he ended up hearing it more than enough because he often ended up engaging with him. That's why Groovy was so familiar with his philosophy.</p>

            <p>But now, having forgotten they had this talk, it was revealed that Cecilus's practice of that theory preceded even his physical abilities, to an extent that was beyond respectful and into the realm of outright foolishness.</p>

            <p>As Groovy and Cecilus exchanged banter, Al, who had been dragged into an alley, managed to lift his body and mutter while looking down at the thorns on his chest.</p>

            <p>"*Cough*... The pain from the thorns subsided?"</p>

            <p>While rubbing his punched stomach and directing a resentful air toward Groovy, he inquired,</p>

            <p>"Being punched in the stomach hurts damn more... What's going on?"</p>

            <p>"It’s your own damn fault for not moving back sooner! ...For the thorns, probably distance."</p>

            <p>"Oh? So, the thorn caster's distance from us is involved here? If the pain vanishes as soon as we move back, that makes sense! It's especially clear to us since we were clinging together. First, Groovy on the stomach side, then Al sandwiched in the middle, and finally me at the back—there was a difference, even if it was less than a second."</p>

            <p>"…But the thorns haven't disappeared."</p>

            <p>Al muttered bitterly as he let his fingers pass through the intangible thorns.</p>

            <p>As he said, even though the pain had faded, the thorns themselves had not vanished. It was worrying that even without the easily discernible hazard of pain, the connection to the thorns remained intact. Usually, such persistent curses had the effect of sensing the presence of their target.</p>

            <p>As long as these thorns remained, it was highly likely that their whereabouts were completely exposed to the enemy.</p>

            <p>"If that's the case, there's no time to sit around pondering. What do we do? Shall we all charge in and take down the person behind the curse?"</p>

            <p>"Not long ago, you said the same thing. What's the reason?"</p>

            <p>"I said it before, but it's a hunch."</p>

            <p>"…Your damn hunch, huh?"</p>

            <p>Groovy couldn't dismiss what Cecilus, readily citing intuition as a reason, was saying as futile nonsense.</p>

            <p>The situation wasn't amusing, nor could his achievements be lightly disregarded. Both Cecilus and Arakiya were intuitive commanders, and each had keen insight for different reasons.</p>

            <p>Groovy also did not believe that the entity causing a disaster of this scale would resort to a straightforward show of force.</p>

            <p>Rather, if the enemy were solely relying on such force, they wouldn't stand a chance against Vincent or Chisha.</p>

            <p>For a moment, Groovy glanced sideways at Cecilus and fell silent.</p>

            <p>Though various thoughts passed through his mind, if the enemy had chosen a one-dimensional approach, it was fundamentally misguided to clash with the Vollachian Empire, which had Cecilus and Arakiya within its ranks.</p>

            <p>In essence, an enemy who made such a mistake could not be a threat to the empire.</p>

            <p>Of course, it was impressive if it was part of the enemy's plan to corner Cecilus this far, but Groovy's own instincts dismissed that idea.</p>

            <p>It was Chisha who had cornered Cecilus. There was no mistake about it from the lingering scent of mana.</p>

            <p>And yet, Chisha joining forces with those who sought to destroy the empire was an impossibility. Nonetheless, Groovy was uncomfortably unable to fathom Chisha's true intentions.</p>

            <p>"If our location is revealed, we can't afford to sit around thinking. What's the next move? Do we all rush in and confront the source of the curse?"</p>

            <p>"Yes, that would be the fastest solution! Or so I'd like to say, but according to Groovy's assessment earlier, the curse's power seems to relate to distance. Meaning, when we distance ourselves, the pain fades. So if we approach too closely..."</p>

            <p>"It might not end with just a tolerable level of pain this time."</p>

            <p>"Perhaps, perhaps."</p>

            <p>Cecilus's speculation is met with nods of agreement, and Al glares begrudgingly at the curse-born thorns on his chest.</p>

            <p>Groovy also concurs with Cecilus's line of thought. An enemy who indiscriminately scatters a curse of thorns within an area poses a frightful threat.</p>

            <p>The closer one gets to the caster, the stronger the curse of the thorns becomes. Likely, most people would become incapacitated by pain long before they could lay their hands on the sorcerer.</p>

            <p>"In that case, even the biggest fool would be immobilized."</p>

            <p>"So you’re looking at me because you think I'm the sort of hothead who might dash in without thinking? I wouldn't plunge forward without a plan, even if enduring agony to cut down the enemy might settle matters. That would be quite the spectacle, wouldn't it—"</p>

            <p>With a deliberate pause, Cecilus claps his hands robustly in front of his chest, making a sound. He then intertwines his fingers, peering through the gap at Groovy and Al, alternating his gaze between them.</p>

            <p>"If decapitating the adversary would solve the issue, you, Groovy, would have sent me forth to do just that by now."</p>

            <p>"...That's the shitty part about curses."</p>

            <p>Before the impishly grinning Cecilus, Groovy can't help but sigh.</p>

            <p>If it were magic, killing the caster would usually nullify its effects, because magic is enacted by a caster using mana to interfere with the world. Once the caster is gone, it ends there.</p>

            <p>Curses, however, are specialized in causing harm, even unto death.</p>

            <p>Therefore, they are often activated by tying themselves to the mana—Od—of the target, meaning they don’t lose their effect even if the caster dies; they will persist as long as the target lives. This curse of thorns is clearly dependent on the Od of the target instead of the caster, making it a prime example of such curses.</p>

            <p>To break such a curse, one either needs the caster to lift it or resort to some trickery.</p>

            <p>"We have the cursed blade Murasame. Fetch it."</p>

            <p>Cecilus and Al both look puzzled at Groovy's directive.</p>

            <p>Ignorance from Al was understandable, but it was vexing how Cecilus, who should have known, had apparently forgotten. Groovy, seething, grabs the annoying Cecilus by the collar.</p>

            <p>"Murasame! That damned sword! It's perfect for slicing through curses and contracts. Get searching!"</p>

            <p>"Eh?! But if it's an unknown sword, how can I find it? Unless, Groovy, can you track it by scent?"</p>

            <p>"Useless. That damned blade can cut its scent too, so I can't sniff it out. Even if it's submerged in a pool of blood year-round, I can't chase it by smell, damn it."</p>

            <p>Even so, Murasame, having been recast from a sword into a katana by Groovy, is averse to his touch and refuses to even let him handle it.</p>

            <p>In terms of being difficult to handle, it's on par with its owner, Cecilus; the "fiend sword" cannot be located by Groovy's nose.</p>

            <p>"But if we have it, we can deal with these thorns, right?"</p>

            <p>As Groovy presses, Cecilus plays dumb, and Al rises to confirm this in a low voice, to which Groovy releases Cecilus and nods in response.</p>

            <p>"If it exists, it's either in that idiot's house or some secret vault. But considering that fool can't keep secrets, it’s unlikely."</p>

            <p>"I agree. Where's this house?"</p>

            <p>"It's in the garden of the Crystal Palace. That moron lives there with Arakiya."</p>

            <p>"Wait, wait, wait! Although I presume when you say that moron you're referring to me, a name I don't recognize just popped up. Who is Arakiya?"</p>

            <p>"Arakiya... Are they together and living in a castle garden? The world’s too small..."</p>

            <p>"No, I doubt that's the case."</p>

            <p>To Al's reasonable muttering, Groovy wrinkles his nose in response.</p>

            <p>The relationship between Cecilus and Arakiya is unclear even to Groovy, who watches from the sidelines. Though it seems they've known each other for nearly ten years, it's a mystery how Cecilus feels about others, and while it's clear that Arakiya despises Cecilus, they live together and share meals.</p>

            <p>One might think they're a couple by scent, but Groovy can't discern anything of the sort between them. Occasionally, they fight to the death so seriously that they alter the empire's geography, proving a nuisance for everyone.</p>

            <p>"But after the fool shrank, I can't imagine they'd simply leave the 'Dream Sword' and 'Fiend Sword' lying around. So the only possibility is..."</p>

            <p>"If we could enter the castle from the start, we would have done that."</p>

            <p>If, as they fear, the blades have been collected and are within the castle, Al is right.</p>

            <p>If one could simply storm the Crystal Palace, there'd be no need to mount an apex siege relying on reinforcements. However, dealing with this caster is a prerequisite for receiving reinforcements.</p>

            <p>"Hmm, who knows? It would be a waste to just leave such incredible weapons lying around in the castle. A significant weapon brought up like that must be used."</p>

            <p>Cecilus, hands clasped behind his head, interjects into the conversation between Groovy and Al.</p>

            <p>With his back turned to the two, he ostentatiously glances over, humming and hawing conspicuously.</p>

            <p>"What’s it, spit it out if you have something to say, instead of mumbling crap."</p>

            <p>"No, no. You two should discuss it among yourselves. Whatever I say won't catch your ears anyway, so never mind, never mind."</p>

            <p>"Getting sulky about Arakiya, aren't we, you wretch! She's the woman you've often tried to kill! She must be somewhere around here! Now speak up, you fool!"</p>

            <p>"Well, since I’m being insisted upon so ardently. The thing is, if I were them, I'd consider it better to give the weapons to someone rather than leave them in the castle."</p>

            <p>Cecilus, who had been sulking, suddenly broke into a smile, causing Groovy to frown. He was frustrated that Cecilus had proposed a surprisingly sensible opinion.</p>

            <p>In other words, if Cecilus' conjecture is correct, it's likely that one of the undead wields the powerful weapons known as the "Dream Sword" and the "Evil Sword."</p>

            <p>Then...</p>

            <p>"If it's such a powerful weapon, wouldn't it be given to someone entrusted with an important place?"</p>

            <p>"Damn."</p>

            <p>Groovy, frustrated, agrees with Cecilus's remark.</p>

            <p>The best strategy, then, would be to eliminate the possible risks and head to the appropriate place.</p>

            <p>"If Balleroy is reluctant to defend the third summit, then it’s someone else. That guy favors his spear; he wouldn’t bother switching to a damned blade."</p>

            <p>"Then it must be elsewhere. It would be unfortunate if Al used your father as bait for nothing."</p>

            <p>"No, I agree that this guy has to be the first one we deal with... It's no joke that he alone could hold us back when the rest of our brothers arrive,"</p>

            <p>Al shook his clenched fist, while the one-eyed Cecilus, squinting at Groovy, understood the sentiment.</p>

            <p>A plan was determined. In order to obtain the "Fiend Sword," the course of action, admittedly haphazard, was to search for likely holders at other summits, but…</p>

            <p>"The damn fool, at least try to draw the right one first. Where's the highest possibility?"</p>

            <p>"Hmm... maybe Number Two?"</p>

            <p>"It's closer from here then. So we use the werewolf skin again and move as three..."</p>

            <p>"No."</p>

            <p>As they decided which summit to head toward, Groovy interrupted Al's words.</p>

            <p>Shaking his head, Groovy threw the werewolf skin coat he had been holding to Al, and turned his back on the two, heading towards the entrance of the alley.</p>

            <p>And then—</p>

            <p>"We split up from here. There's a need to keep this damned enemy from moving by putting pressure on their head. It's a shitty role, but I'm the only one who can do it."</p>

            <p>"—Wait, I get it, but there are thorns in the way! We share the same conditions, don't we?!"</p>

            <p>Ignoring Al's attempt to stop him, Groovy didn't pause his stride.</p>

            <p>Al, trying to follow, was stopped by a light touch from Cecilus' small hand on his chest. Holding back Al, Cecilus asked the departing Groovy.</p>

            <p>"You have a plan to win, right?"</p>

            <p>"Least I could do is buy the damn fool some time to work. Who do you think I am? I'm 'Land,' Groovy Gumlet of the Nine Divine Generals."</p>

            <p>Groovy raised his arm in a bold gesture, declaring the basis for his confidence to Cecilus over his shoulder.</p>

            <p>It seemed that Cecilus was particularly struck by this. He exhaled a cheerful snort, as if his good mood was recognizable without looking, and said,</p>

            <p>"Then, by all means, go forth to your heart's content. Next time, we shall meet with the 'Fiend Sword'!"</p>

            <p>With these words, reminiscent of the spiel of a famed actor he was used to hearing, Cecilus sent Groovy, kicking off the cobblestones, off to the battlefield.</p>

            <p>△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>—Having parted with Cecilus and Al, Groovy was now leaping alone through the imperial capital.</p>

            <p>Unabashedly hopping over streets, kicking off the walls and roofs of buildings, he bounded with gusto. From here on, unlike the covert operations whilst clad in werewolf skin, he had to move flamboyantly to draw the enemy's attention.</p>

            <p>Finally, finally, it was time for Groovy to truly come into his element.</p>

            <p>"Making me do such damned cramping nonsense..."</p>

            <p>Groovy, his voice laced with pent-up irritation, cursed bitterly.</p>

            <p>By nature, Groovy disliked actions such as fleeing in panic or skulking to avoid the watchful eyes of others—not a matter of competence, but of distaste.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, ever since he was forced to leave the western front due to the appearance of undead, he had been endlessly compelled to continue such behaviors all the way to the imperial capital, and now his patience was at its limit.</p>

            <p>Of course, this frustration was not the reason he proposed splitting up, but now that he had the opportunity to rampage freely, he intended to relish it.</p>

            <p>"—You've come, you bastard."</p>

            <p>Curled into a ball and spinning vertically in the air, Groovy felt the twining thorns on his wolf-hair-covered chest squirming, reactivating the bind as the magic caster closed the distance, bringing about a pain that pierced directly into his heart—a pain not easily endured, even for a hardened warrior accustomed to suffering.</p>

            <p>However—</p>

            <p>"If it's a cursed spell meant to torment the enemy, there's always a way out!"</p>

            <p>With a howl, Groovy extracted a short dagger from the belt wrapped around his body.</p>

            <p>From among several daggers, he chose one with a purple stripe on the blade, and pointed its tip at his own throat, pressing the edge into himself.</p>

            <p>At that moment, the poison concealed in the tip of the short dagger surged into Groovy's body, racing through his blood and rapidly corroding the diminutive frame of the wolfdog man. The venom, rejoicing at the fulfillment of its primary function to kill living things, raced through eager to fatally halt his vital activities—just before this happened, Groovy withdrew the blade.</p>

            <p>"—Gah."</p>

            <p>Suppressing the sensation of his gut's contents refluxing, Groovy's eyes flew wide open, bloodshot.</p>

            <p>The capillaries in his eyeballs burst, staining his vision red, yet Groovy's body, on the brink of death from the toxin, held firm, bringing a different kind of distortion instead.</p>

            <p>A part of his body's sensations dimmed due to the venom—he had killed his sense of pain.</p>

            <p>Instantly, the pain of the thorns that nearly stopped Groovy's feet vanished, and the constriction around his heart was overcome by exhilaration that had forcefully surpassed a life-threatening crisis.</p>

            <p>Originally, this poison was meant to be administered to captured enemies for torture—allowing them to remain conscious without feeling pain, to clearly witness their own bodies being destroyed. Yet, with precise dosage adjustments like this, he could remain active while only eradicating the sensation of pain. While Groovy had wanted to test this and had never found the opportunity, it seemed to work effectively on the spot.</p>

            <p>"If I experimented with Cecilus, the damn fool, there would be no taking it back if something went wrong."</p>

            <p>With his body, he understood every single beast hair and fang without a hint of deviation, which allowed for such fine tuning. But to experiment on Cecilus or Al would require a lethal guesswork in measurement.</p>

            <p>There was no absence of curiosity bubbling up within him, a desire to test whether Cecilus too could be killed by the poison, but holding back that rising curiosity, Groovy headed for the third summit.</p>

            <p>The situation called for it. Saving the Vollachian Empire from the brink of destruction was the ultimate priority.</p>

            <p>Ideally, Groovy would have liked to take full advantage of the situation with the undead resurrecting, collecting materials from already extinct species or those of limited rare races. However, he could only swallow his tears and let it pass.</p>

            <p>There were reasons boiling within Groovy that were more than enough to do so.</p>

            <p>"Damn it."</p>

            <p>The curses he spat out briefly voiced an exasperation that would not fade.</p>

            <p>—From the moment he laid eyes on the undead-dominated imperial capital, Groovy had been conscious that either Vincent or Chisha might be dead. And if one of them had died, it would most likely be Chisha.</p>

            <p>There had been signs to Vincent's fate, a certain indifference to death tagging along, but then, at some point, that aura vanished, only for this crisis to follow.</p>

            <p>"That damn white-faced stupid bastard..."</p>

            <p>While Vincent was a man who rarely revealed his emotions, he had completely masked his innermost thoughts even from the scents around him.</p>

            <p>In the face of the impending imperial capital battle, it was Vincent's order that had sent Groovy away from the battlefield to the west, but it must have been Chisha all along.</p>

            <p>During that period, how Vincent fared was beyond Groovy's knowledge, and considering Cecilus' shrinkage, it pointed to Chisha's solo victory.</p>

            <p>But such a victory would be nullified if the empire itself were to lose.</p>

            <p>"Damn it."</p>

            <p>As if such ridiculousness could be tolerated.</p>

            <p>Groovy was born in the Empire, raised in the Empire, and lives as a bearded dog-man of the Empire. His work was critical for the elevation of his race's status, and he was continually told that it was his duty to fight bravely and die valiantly. Groovy was aware that he was born to etch his name in the annals of Imperial history, and indeed, he was quickly noticed by the Emperor and rose meteorically to become one of the top generals of the Empire. It was with "The Nine Divine Generals" that Groovy was acknowledged as an equal, if not superior.</p>

            <p>Groovy, a warrior of the Empire, was a follower of the philosophy that "the people of the Empire must be strong." That was why victory and defeat were sacred to him—victors must be celebrated and acclaimed.</p>

            <p>"Curses, curses, curses, curses, curses, curses, curses...!"</p>

            <p>In the never-ending battles of Vollachia, if this unwritten law was twisted, the world would become hell. And hell was meant for the enemies of Vollachia—not something to turn this world into. It was imperative to teach the enemies where hell really lies.</p>

            <p>"―curse spotted."</p>

            <p>Groovy muttered as he spotted several figures moving within his spinning field of vision. The undead crowd below also noticed Groovy flying overhead and began shouting something. Their reactions, however, were too slow. They weren't harmful even if ignored, but there was no reason to ignore them. Above all, within the scent of blood, Groovy had no option but to pursue his prey.</p>

            <p>With a clash of his fangs, Groovy drew the chain scythe strapped to his back. It was an unusual weapon, a wide scythe connected to a weighted chain, usually handled with one hand. Normally, chain scythes are designed to fight at short to medium distances, with the chain being only a few meters long, but Groovy's was made of special material. As a result, even at nearly thirty meters away, the weighted end reached the undead group with ease.</p>

            <p>Swinging his scythe-bearing hand mightily, the trailing weight swung out, playing the sound of the chain as it grandly flew towards the ground. Despite the size of the weight being only as big as a fist, the force of acceleration made it incomparable to a mere punch. Naturally, the undead tried to dodge in vain—how naïve.</p>

            <p>"Stupid idiots!"</p>

            <p>Groovy's roar was directed at the weight, which made contact with the ground. Instantly, the weight glowed red from within and exploded, enveloping nearby buildings in a massive burst, and the shockwave engulfed the fleeing undead, destroying an entire street of the imperial capital.</p>

            <p>Near the Great Waterfall to the northwest of the Kararagi City-State lay The Crimson Hills of Girall. With the appearance of a red desert, this land, made of fine fire mana crystal particles reminiscent of grains of sand, is one of the world's most dangerous places. Just a gust of wind can cause an extraordinary chain of explosions, and this land is said to be formed by the blood and tears of a great spirit who missed being one of the four greats. Inside Groovy's chain scythe's weight were fire magic stones collected from The Crimson Hills of Girall, which absorbed the surrounding mana to unleash its tremendous destructive power.</p>

            <p>Bathed in the aftermath of the heatwave that blew away the entire street, Groovy landed on the scorched earth, straightened his back with a jerk, and let out a mighty roar as the impulse for destruction swelled inside him.</p>

            <p>His heart pulsated, challenging the constriction of thorns, yet there was no pain. Simply reveling in the sensation of being scorched from within, Groovy expelled a breath saturated with the scent of blood. Then, clenching his fangs and readjusting his grip on the chain scythe, he barked,</p>

            <p>"With that damn curse, you can't possibly hope for a successful surprise attack!"</p>

            <p>Groovy launched the weight aloft toward a figure descending from above, their red cloak fluttering. The demonstrated power of the weight was proven as the figure caught it with a sword, and in a burst, they were engulfed in flames.</p>

            <p>But then—</p>

            <p>"Tch!"</p>

            <p>The moment Groovy saw the flames split in two, he leaped backward. The unnatural split in the flames was proof that the descending figure had slashed through them. And the thorns pulsing excitedly, as if cheering for their master's arrival, informed Groovy that this was the very person who had cast the thorn curse on him and those around.</p>

            <p>If not for the poison silencing his pain, he would have been writhing and spitting blood at this moment. If this foe relied solely on thorns, Groovy would have had the upper hand entirely, but unfortunately, it seemed this enemy was no easy task.</p>

            <p>"Surprise attack is an entirely different matter. Why should I, of all people, resort to such underhanded tactics?"</p>

            <p>While saying this, the figure that had landed in the scorched wasteland slowly turned to face here. With cracked pale skin, golden pupils floating in black eyes, the figure indeed met the conditions of an undead. Their appearance was as expected, but it changed everything, adding layers to Groovy's predictions.</p>

            <p>Firstly, the attire marked with designs only permitted to Vollachian royalty, a face that somewhat reminded one of Vincent Vollachia, and more importantly, the weapon in hand.</p>

            <p>That was the glowing red "Yang Sword"—an honor reserved only for the Emperor of Vollachia.</p>

            <p>"Damn it."</p>

            <p>If the undead were reviving, it was natural that members of the Vollachian royal family would be involved.</p>

            <p>Thus, the fact that the figure was wielding the "Yang Sword" was shocking, yet understandable. What he couldn't understand, however, was not just that alone.</p>

            <p>The undead emperor with the "Yang Sword" in his right hand bore another distinct weapon in his left. And it was a weapon that Groovy hadn't anticipated the undead would have here—</p>

            <p>"—Just how far will this damned blade dare to defy me!"</p>

            <p>Boiling with rage, Groovy saw that the undead emperor held the "Fiend Sword" Murasame. "The Yang Sword" and "Fiend Sword," these impossible magical swords stood in front of Groovy Gumlet, the "Cursed Weapons Master," as enemies.</p>
