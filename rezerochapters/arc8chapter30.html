        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>――The "Fortress City" Garkla is known as one of the top five major cities in the Vollachian Empire. Situated along the border of two nations, the Kingdom of Lugunica and the Kararagi City-State, Garkla backs onto a large mountain, with several sturdy fortresses within its walls, making it a formidable defensive stronghold.</p>

            <p>However, the legend of its invincibility fell apart a dozen or so years ago when it was sacked by "Greed," the Archbishop of Sin from the Witch Cult. The damage was the worst in the Empire's history, with several thousand of the city's regular soldiers killed, the death of "Eight Arms" Kurgan, who was hailed as the Empire's greatest warrior, and the destruction of multiple fortresses.</p>

            <p>Since then, deep scars have been etched into the fortress city, and the city's restoration and functional recovery are still not complete. Tension between the nations remains high.</p>

            <p>"That was the state of affairs in the fortress city, as understood by the Kingdom."</p>

            <p>Roswaal stood by the windowsill of the main fortress' conference room, which was built in the middle of the neighboring Guildrey mountain, overlooking the city with a smile. The city has several shelters equipped with sufficient space and abundant supplies, housing refugees and soldiers who had barely escaped from the imperial capital, all easy signs of relief. The actualisation of this scenario relied on the multiple fortresses built during a past lifetime, none of which were only partially constructed.</p>

            <p>"The situation is very different from what I heard... in the Empire, the rumor was that the fortress city was in the middle of reconstruction."</p>

            <p>Not only outsiders but even the Empire's citizens are unaware of the reality within the fortress city. If any nation moves at the information that the fortress city is incomplete, they would be welcomed by the Empire, which has a fully operational regime.</p>

            <p>Incredible, the Empire will even use their own scandals if it is for war, a fact so shocking it leaves one in awe. And then――</p>

            <p>"If the Kingdom's first-ranked magician believed that, it seems like our information control was effective."</p>

            <p>"So, there's no way you'd leave visible and audible weaknesses, huh? Well, I am utterly humbled by the Empire's thoroughness."</p>

            <p>There was a voice in agreement, and Roswaal turned back with a shrug. Standing in front was a white-haired old man--Imperial Chancellor Berstetz Fondalfon. During the previous attack on the chain dragon carriage, this man's valiant fight had been instrumental in turning the tide. He had once fallen from the dragon carriage and his survival had been in jeopardy, but at the last moment, Frederica, who had been chasing the carriage, arrived just in time to rescue him, and thus they met again in the fortress city. However, his return was not without injury.</p>

            <p>"How are you feeling? The range of your burns was quite extensive,"</p>

            <p>"I appreciate your concern. Fortunately, thanks to her healing magic, I am still alive. My limbs are somewhat impaired... but for me, it's an unexpected grace."</p>

            <p>"Is that so..."</p>

            <p>Propped on his cane with one hand, Berstetz was dragging his right leg. No matter how powerful the healing magic, a miracle would be required to exceed the person's recovery limit significantly. Unfortunately, it seemed that Berstetz's miracle had only stretched as far as saving his life. Still, the old man seemed to perceive even that as an extraordinary miracle.</p>

            <p>"After all, the human casualties were minimal, and we were fortunate to enter the fortress city without losing significant strength. It is regrettable that the chancellor has been disabled, but we can't hope for more."</p>

            <p>This was said by Serena, who had entered the meeting room with Roswaal. She was seated at one side of the round table placed in the middle of the room, tracing her facial scar with a finger. She pulled back the chair next to her for Berstetz. At her unexpected consideration, Berstetz bowed and took his seat.</p>

            <p>"Dracroy Countess, your words are disrespectful, but your gestures are considerate… I am unsure on how to perceive you."</p>

            <p>"Don't think about it so much. This is just me. If this fortress were to fall, I would carry the chancellor, old as a dead tree, and run, while openly voicing my opinion about the effort,”</p>

            <p>"I see. It's too complex to understand”</p>

            <p>Berstetz's frankness thus further complicated Serena's charm, but his reaction seemed somehow incisively sharp. The attack of the swarm of corpse dragons, led by the "Poisonous Princess", and in addition, the emergence of "Three-headed" Valgren, halted by "Admirer" Halibel, honestly, it was the worst event imaginable.</p>

            <p>"However, including Berstetz's survival, we can say that the situation has settled miraculously. However, there are controversial parts concerning how this miracle happened.</p>

            <p>"Are you certain? Is it true that Lamia can no longer be saved?" Berstetz, now seated at the round table, questioned with an unusual heat in his tone. Roswaal noticed but, unlike Serena, didn't press indecorously.</p>

            <p>Instead, Roswaal retracted his jaw, "It seems that our opponents have found a way to break the spell mixing 'sacrament of the Immortal King' and restoration magic. Princess Lamia Godwin’s means of resurrection have been taken away through this method... No, in this case,"</p>

            <p>"Perhaps saying 'saved' is a bit arrogant," Serena, rather pointedly, highlighted a point he was hesitant to verbalize.</p>

            <p>On that matter, Roswaal didn’t have a clear answer. He was unsure whether a life revived as a zombie would appreciate its existence.</p>

            <p>Personally speaking, he would not categorically say that resurrection of life was evil. However, the state of being resurrected as a zombie-like entity –</p>

            <p>"– was saved, or rather, freed. It would be appropriate to say so."</p>

            <p>"Oh? For you to say that is surprising, Chancellor."</p>

            <p>Serena raised an eyebrow at Berstetz’s words, expressing interest. In the gaze directed at him, Berstetz placed both hands on the base of his staff and took a long breath,</p>

            <p>"I do not think that Lamia approved of such a state. She must have recognized her defeat... That was an unsolicited opportunity."</p>

            <p>"So are you saying she would have preferred to be killed? It's a little inconsistent with being attacked by her increasing numbers,"</p>

            <p>"…Regardless, I believe her true intent was different." Berstetz, narrowed eyed and whispering, couldn’t hide his audible wish.</p>

            <p>Roswaal felt like he understood Berstetz's feelings. Unfortunately, they seemed totally lost on Serena, sitting there nonchalantly.</p>

            <p>Anyway, this was a point that was prominently included in their discussion.</p>

            <p>"The enemy is powerful and the situation is chaotic. We are in a precarious situation where we must unite. We certainly can't afford to have internal disputes, can we now, Subaru?"</p>

            <p>"...I know that without being told."</p>

            <p>Roswaal entered the conference room with a light-hearted laugh, "Good day!" 
            A black-haired boy who just peeked his face through the door responded with a grimace.</p>

            <p>"Although we couldn't discuss this in the heat of the emergency situation, I'd like to share some information. This Louis, now also known as Spica, used to be an Archbishop of Witch Cult."</p>

            <p>"Oh!"</p>

            <p>At the very beginning of the discussion in the grand fortress's meeting room, Subaru openly revealed the true identity of Spica, who was standing next to him. Those who already understood the situation due to the chain of events in the carriage accepted this confession calmly. As expected, the reactions from the uninformed imperial side were quite intense.</p>

            <p>First, they were astounded and shocked, then came the reaction that was the same whether the confession was a fact or a joke - outrage.</p>

            <p>"What, what are you saying! An Archbishop!? Impossible! Are you aware of where you are!? This city once fell to an Archbishop!!"</p>

            <p>The one who bellowed with a voice louder than usual was Goz Ralfon. His contribution to the defense of the chain-linked carriage was significant, and he had joined the conference, only with partial treatment of his wounds. His shout was likely the general sentiment of those hearing the story for the first time. But this was neither a joke nor a game.</p>

            <p>"I have also heard about that scumbag Regulus wreaking havoc in this town. I don't know if it will be of any comfort, but we managed to finish that guy off. So, please forget about him for now."</p>

            <p>"I don't care about that detestable villain! What's important is the cursed title of Archbishop and the sin it carries! Do you understand that!?”</p>

            <p>"...I understand."</p>

            <p>The loudness of Goz's voice caused a sensation as if a wind was blowing. However, Subaru did not step back from Goz's angry outburst and responded head-on. Even the aggressive Goz was taken aback by a child like Subaru responding straightforwardly, causing his eyes to widen.</p>

            <p>"Is that alright?"</p>

            <p>As Goz staggered, Berstetz raised his hand alternatively. The imperial chancellor narrowed his eyes to threadlike slits as he looked at Subaru and Spica standing beside him.</p>

            <p>"Giving away such information implies the necessity of her existence and skills in our upcoming discussions. Is that tied with Lamia being released from the gallows of the undead?"</p>

            <p>"Ah, that's right. I'm glad you caught on quickly. Afterall, I'd be in a real spot of trouble if Berstetz had just gone and died on us," confirmed Subaru, speaking almost more to himself as he pieced together Berstetz's theory.</p>

            <p>In the maelstrom of the carousel battle, Berstetz had single-handedly confronted Lamia, putting his life on the line to exclude her and her counterpart from the "protection against winds." That being said, it was a completely arbitrary act, and Berstetz had nearly lost his life.</p>

            <p>"Please, don't let even the smart ones like yourself fall into the Imperial way of thinking. There's nothing noble in risking your life to accomplish something."</p>

            <p>"There are various opinions about that... but at least, there doesn't seem to be much to gain in exchange for my life. Noted," Berstetz replied, conceding where necessary and taking a firm stand where he couldn't.</p>

            <p>Subaru seemed to share this perspective, so they were likely to disagree on the value of life, though Subaru had no intention whatsoever of letting any of them nobly sacrifice themselves.</p>

            <p>"So? Since you confirmed the Chancellor's question, there's no doubt that this daughter of a Sin Archbishop was highly effective against the undead. What exactly did she do?"</p>

            <p>"About that... it's difficult to explain in detail, however..." Serena, resting her head on her hand on the round table, prioritised curiosity over hostility towards Spica. She posed an obvious question, causing Subaru to glance briefly towards Spica.</p>

            <p>The blue-eyed girl flutters her gaze, lifting her clasped hands,</p>

            <p>"Spica, with the "Authority of Gluttony", can eat away at the special powers of anyone whose name she knows... or so I think. This allows her to nullify the unlimited resurrection technique of zombies."</p>

            <p>"That's a somewhat airy explanation, isn't it? If you don't tell us more clearly, we'll be left with nothing but anxiety and no reassurance."</p>

            <p>"I agree! I wish I could provide a more persuasive and specific explanation!" At Subaru's vague explanation, Anastasia, his supposed ally, shoots him an unapologetically chiding response.</p>

            <p>However, it was only natural that he’d been targeted, and it was unavoidable that the hit would cause a fatal wound. On the other hand, it was also true that Subaru could only explain it that way.</p>

            <p>"Anyway, Subaru's aim was on point. Did that troublesome princess zombie run away because of that girl's authority? The retreat wasn't a bluff or a feint."
            
            "I agree with Beatrice's opinion. Furthermore, the 'Pruning Squad' that tried to stay on the field and buy their master time... I don't think their struggle was a product of compromise."
            
            "You two give sentimental answers, alright. But that's all circumstantial evidence... Do you understand that it's too dangerous to use this powerful medicine without being sure of its effects?"
            
            "Well... of course, I think I understand."
            
            Even with the support of Beatrice and Julius, the validity of Anastasia's sound argument doesn't waver.</p>

            <p>The correctness of her viewpoint was clear from the response of the imperials who they must convince anew. The empire needed defending, but it was a difficult judgment to say the least, whether dealing with the risks was worth it considering the Sin Archbishops.</p>

            <p>"Star-gazer" Ublik had mentioned two lights to counteract the "Great Calamity" -- one of which, its survival, was deemed to be in a hopeless situation, meaning they could realistically only rely on one of them - Spica.</p>

            <p>After the zombies’ onslaught that was found to be the "sacrament of the Undead King" and the application of restoration magic due to Beatrice and others' desperate investigations, Subaru came to realize the potential of Spica.
            She targeted the souls of zombies using the "Gluttony" authority – specifically, how exactly Spica’s authority came into play and culminated in a result, as mentioned before, was unknown.
            
            Yet, Subaru and the others have not forgotten the "name" Lamia Godwin who had been targeted by Spica’s power, and the same could be said about her half-brother Abel.</p>

            <p>There was no sign of memory loss in Lamia when she left. Therefore, she didn't have her "memories" devoured. --So, what did Spica devour?</p>

            <p>As things stand, it could only be surmised as destiny, causality, a role, or a status abnormality at the time – it was in a situation where such overreach of theories had to be lined up.</p>

            <p>Of course, that was not persuasive enough, and Anastasia’s comment clicked.</p>

            <p>"But, this child might be able to stop the other "zombies", right? That's a very important thing, I think."</p>

            <p>By Subaru's side, as he struggled with deep thought, Emilia, granted a seat at the round table, lowered her eyebrows and spoke up. Upon hearing Emilia's thoughts, Anastasia narrowed her light blue eyes.</p>

            <p>"I'm not saying I don't understand your feelings, Emilia. I too am fed up with the fuss over this "Great Disaster" and feel the same impulse to jump at a plan that could lead to victory. But the power of an archbishop should not be taken lightly…"</p>

            <p>"No, that's not it. Of course, that’s a concern too, but… I just really want to do something about the people who have died turning into "zombies.""</p>

            <p>"Do something about the zombies?"</p>

            <p>"I can't quite express it... Seeing people who are gone being moved around as zombies is very upsetting. Abel didn’t want to meet his sister in such a way, either. And Medium...”</p>

            <p>Lowering her eyes framed by long lashes, Emilia mentioned Medium, who was not present. Her absence seemed more due to her physical condition than her being left out from the discussions. The cause was the last undead they encountered...</p>

            <p>Spica, due to the "Star Eating" effect, lost her regenerative power and was on the verge of extinction. Lamia followed her call, and a corpse dragon retrieved her body, its pilot turned into one of the undead. It turned out, the pilot and siblings Flop and Medium knew each other.</p>

            <p>Shocked by the fact that one of her acquaintances had turned into an undead, Medium did not leave her room in the fortress after surviving this crisis.</p>

            <p>The normally cheerful and positive Medium had a valid reason for being depressed. Subaru was heartbroken, but he realized he hadn't shown her as much care as Emilia had. It made him catch his breath at Emilia's words.</p>

            <p>He had been focused only on the threat of the zombies, not considering the sadness they brought.</p>

            <p>"...My thoughts differ from Lady Emilia's, but there's no doubt that these zombies are troublesome. They've been resurrected in an unnatural way, after all. If there are absolutely no flaws with them, it would be too convenient."</p>

            <p>As Subaru digressed, deeply moved by Emilia's words, it was Otto who interrupted him. He had been silently observing the situation for a while. Leaning against the fortress wall and gazing up at the ceiling, he...</p>

            <p>"Zombies can't just be beings that are simply resurrected. Even ignoring that we're dealing with a situation where a large number of zombies... made up by just one woman, have appeared, I doubt all of them harbored resentment towards His Majesty the Emperor in life. Surely."  
            
            "That's right, surely so."</p>

            <p>"No matter how you look at it, surely it's impossible."</p>

            <p>Swayed by the lingering trust in Otto's interjected question and defense, Subaru and the others nod. Even if Abel appeared as an autocratic and heartless emperor to others, there was no doubt that he was an emperor who was not only detested but also respected. Subaru himself had witnessed this nearly unbelievable fact through his own experiences while traveling the Empire. In other words--</p>

            <p>"We should assume that the aggressive consciousness toward His Excellency Vincent and Vollachian Empire is either implanted or amplified during the process of resurrection as a zombie."</p>

            <p>"So, it's brainwashing... That seems to be a reasonable opinion."</p>

            <p>" ... I heard it from the soldiers fighting behind us. There are instances when a soldier who had been fighting alongside us gets taken down, that soldier immediately turns into a zombie and attacks."</p>

            <p>"So a comrade who fought alongside us would immediately attack when transformed into a zombie. Otto-dono's conjecture seems to be accurate."</p>

            <p>"――. Yes."</p>

            <p>Otto, who had voiced his personal view on the zombies, coldly responds to Julius, who had agreed with his opinion. Subaru frowned at the stiff interaction, but Julius and Anastasia didn't seem to be bothered, accepting it naturally. Regardless--</p>

            <p>"Your opinion, Otto-kun, is something that I was discussing with the chancellor and Lord Dracroy just before you arrived. So don't make that unpleasant face."</p>

            <p>"We'll delve into the relationship between Roswaal and the domestic affairs official another day. The chancellor had the same opinion, right?"</p>

            <p>As Roswaal and Serena turned the topic towards him, Berstetz nods. With his hands on his cane, he looked over the conference participants with his unreadable slit-eyes,</p>

            <p>"Considering Lady Lamia's character, she wouldn't desire a second life. Especially not scheme to overturn the death of her first life through it."</p>

            <p>"So in the end, they've been brainwashed to attack us aggressively, huh?"</p>

            <p>"That's one way to think about it. ...Of course, there's a possibility that they were resurrected, unable to resist, and the current empire was tested to see if it was worth remaining."</p>

            <p>"If that's so, then the Royal Family of Vollachia...!"</p>

            <p>"I'd like you to stop with that sentiment for now..."</p>

            <p>Keeping in mind that he might not have made certain decisions if he were in his right mind, Berstetz was somewhat proud to concede that he could not deny the possibility of having made illogical choices even when sane. In any case, it seemed all present agreed that a zombie's thought process was far from normal.</p>

            <p>"Resurrected zombies are unequivocally hostile to us. In that regard, as Emilia mentioned, we need to end the zombie attack as quickly as possible. For that, we need the power of Spica. As a matter of reality, I think this is non-negotiable."</p>

            <p>"Are you considering the number of zombies? Should we meticulously eliminate each one? If we are discussing realities, I think we cannot  ignore that."</p>

            <p>"If we have to, we'll do just that. We didn’t choose this path expecting to only chew on the tasty parts and throw away the rest,"</p>

            <p>Subaru aggressively insisted, holding Spica's hand not only metaphorically but physically as well.</p>

            <p>Receiving Subaru's intense gaze, Otto shot a suspicious, prying look at Spica. She confronts his doubt head on, returning Subaru's grip on her hand,</p>

            <p>"Auu au–!"</p>

            <p>Spica let out a determined growl, signifying her decision to tread the thorny path.</p>

            <p>Listening to Spica's response, Otto exhaled through his nose before saying,</p>

            <p>"Just to be clear, persuading me is pointless. I don’t have the authority to include her in our strategy."</p>

            <p>"Even if you don’t possess the authority to speak in the council, your influence among us is substantial. At the very least, you can't convince anyone else if you can't persuade your own people,"</p>

            <p>"Is that so? Maybe I should have been more stringent with my judgments then,"</p>

            <p>Otto answered with a shrug, showing no intention of retracting his previous statement. He probably had already prepared to endure the hardships when he had Spica engage Lamia with her "Star Eating" ability in the wagon-chain battle. Subaru just wasn't satisfied leaving things be without confirming it.</p>

            <p>"You seem quite reassured, but don't think I'm fully convinced yet,"</p>

            <p>"Ugh... Conversely, what would make you agree, Anastasia?"</p>

            <p>Once an internal consensus had been reached, Anastasia, who was semi-inside, stood in their way. At least in this empire, she, who is in a position of being in the same boat, put a finger on her lips in response to Subaru's sour question.
            
            "I really want you to think for yourself, but it's better than moaning with an elusive answer. Firstly, you need to confirm what she can do and, if possible, the effects thereafter."</p>

            <p>"What she can do and its subsequent effects..."</p>

            <p>"By 'what she can do', you mean that she can prevent the 'zombies' from rising again, right? But, what do you mean by 'what happens afterwards'?"</p>

            <p>"You, Natsuki-kun and Emilia know how terrible the power of 'Gluttony' can be, don't you?"</p>

            <p>At Anastasia's quiet remark, Subaru held his breath, and Emilia widened her eyes. Naturally, it was a matter that could not be avoided. The authority of 'Gluttony' has caused victims all over the world. Even in this meeting room, there are Emilia and Julius, and Rem is also in the fortress. Or rather, in the sense that it affects the surroundings, one could say that everyone is a victim of 'Gluttony'. Once you decide to use that power, it is natural to estimate the risk.</p>

            <p>"...Is it currently the case that no one has forgotten about that multiplied daughter?"</p>

            <p>"That's right. But, no one thinks nothing has been eaten. It may not be a 'name' or a 'memory', but what happens to that girl after accumulating whatever she ate?"</p>

            <p>"That is..."</p>

            <p>"Isn’t it possible that the original her won’t come back, which Natsuki-kun seemed to be greatly suspicious about?"</p>

            <p>At Anastasia's relentless questioning, Subaru had no choice but to keep silent. All he could do was pray emotionally without any basis in fact. The girl who was given a new name, Spica, instead of Louis Arneb, and chose a different way of life.</p>

            <p>In a way, many people affirm the authority this child was born with and is guided towards the positive.</p>

            <p>"Anastasia-sama, that is something we cannot verify. Of course, I think we should not let our guard down..."</p>

            <p>"I am also unable to prove that I am not planning any nonexistent schemes. If that is the case, I would at least want a conviction that there will be a return on treading down a dangerous road."</p>

            <p>"So, this means that Miss Spica's power has yielded definite results?" Julius touched the scar beneath his left eye as Anastasia affirmatively nodded in response. She then glanced at both Subaru and Spica, commenting, "No merchant would go into a negotiation holding something of unclear value. At least, without knowing how it can be used, the selling point might miss the mark."</p>

            <p>"Indeed," he conceded. Given that Lamia's assault had ceased, it was presumably because she had been defeated. However, the only other evidence was the cryptic prophecy of Ublik, who was suspicious in both existence and behavior as a "Stargazer." Until this concern can be eliminated, Anastasia was already accommodating enough. If only there was some proof that Spica's "Star Eating" effect indeed worked on the zombies - then everyone could finally be convinced.</p>

            <p>"Regrettably, we don't have the luxury of time to devote to testing," an unexpected baritone intruded, rudely disrupting the atmosphere that was tilting against Subaru. Everyone's gazes were immediately drawn to the thin figure with black hair who had just appeared at the entrance of the meeting room. It was Abel, who should have starred in this meeting, but instead had arrived late. Accompanied by Flop and for some reason, Jamal, he confidently made his way to the table and promptly seated himself at an unoccupied spot.</p>

            <p>"And why are you all looking so surprised?" he asked.</p>

            <p>"Well, we were just taken aback by your brazen lateness. You told us to start without you, but what were you doing?" someone asked.</p>

            <p>"I had something urgent to verify. The main reason why I hurried us to this fortress city was just for that. ——To ascertain the true intention behind the words left by the fool," Abel replied, utterly unfazed. Subaru hesitated to further question him, guessing that the "fool" Abel referred to must have been the subordinate who deceived and bested Abel, but chose to spare his life.</p>

            <p>However, the reason for their hurried journey to this fortress city intrigued Subaru, "So, the story that Abel told us, is that why we rushed to this town?"</p>

            <p>"Of course, the fact that it was in the most suitable location to accept refugees is also true," Abel responded.</p>

            <p>"Can you cut to the chase and explain? What does 'we don't have time' mean?" came another question, this time from Emilia and Anastasia. Both of their queries were directed at Abel.</p>

            <p>Everyone in the meeting room shared the same question. Under their gaze, probing for the true intent of his statement, Abel narrowed his eye and tapped the round table.
            
            The sharp sound reverberated, directing Subaru and the others' attention inevitably towards his hand.
            
            "To put it bluntly, what I wanted to confirm in this fortress city was nothing other than the location and condition of the Great Spirit "Stone" of the Empire, one of the 'Beyond Four' that lies within the sacred area there."</p>

            <p>"The 'Beyond Four' Great Spirits...Are you referring to the Four Great Spirits?"
            
            "That is correct."</p>

            <p>Suddenly, unexpected information popped out, causing Subaru to blink repeatedly.</p>

            <p>The Big Four Spirits were beings that he was taught about right from when he first arrived to this different world, and once again when he formed a contract with Beatrice to become a spirit arts user.</p>

            <p>In this world, the spirits among the strongest spirits—Although the credibility of that could be doubted given the fact that Puck, the goofy grayish-brown cat, was included in them.</p>

            <p>"So, you have discovered the location of one of the 'Beyond Four', the 'Stone' Muspel, in the Empire!"
            
            "S-should we be that surprised about this?"</p>

            <p>"Of course. The 'Slasher' of the city-state, the 'Sacred Beast' of the Kingdom of Gusteko, they all gather unwavering faith and reverence in each country. The 'Stone' is an entity that holds a similar power."</p>

            <p>"If we could establish a cooperative relationship with the Big Four Spirits, it would be a major event for the nation...It would definitely be much bigger news than city rebuilds."</p>

            <p>Hearing the gravity of the situation being continuously explained by Julius and Anastasia, Subaru could only be genuinely shocked.</p>

            <p>However, since no one corrected them, and Emilia and Beatrice seemed to be looking quite smug, it appeared that their understanding was correct.</p>

            <p>The problem was—</p>

            <p>"If you hurried to confirm the location and status of the 'Stone' in the fortress city, does that mean the Great Spirit is here? Surely, if we could borrow their power, it would be a great help..."</p>

            <p>Spica's "Star Eating" was not adequate against the endlessly surging enemies.</p>

            <p>Of course, having as much forces as possible to hold back the zombie's fierce attacks while preparing "Star Eating" to detonate was desirable. Alternatively, like Puck, who was more focused on area attacks than the current Emilia, the 'Stone' could also have formidable power.</p>

            <p>"Sadly, things won't work out that way. Earlier, His Majesty the Emperor mentioned that 'there's no time', remember everyone?"</p>

            <p>"Flop?"</p>

            <p>Flop, who was shaking his head loosely, put a hold to Subaru's optimistic thinking. Just like Medium, he was always maintaining a bright and positive attitude, but now, he tightened his expression, uttering his words in a serious manner.</p>

            <p>For whatever reason, he, who accompanied Abel, saw the same thing as the emperor. His expression-- having shared the conclusion a step faster than Subaru and the others--if that's the case...</p>

            <p>"The 'Stone' you all are hoping for won't be able to lend assistance. Rather, the existence of the 'Stone' itself has become a tool for the enemy...for the 'Disaster' to take advantage of," Flop reported.</p>

            <p>"What do you mean... The Great Spirit--"</p>

            <p>"It's in the hands of the enemy. Most likely, the boundless mana of the 'Stone' is being used to incessantly summon ghoul from their graves. Because of this, they continue to surge endlessly."</p>

            <p>"----------"</p>

            <p>"And then--"</p>

            <p>Subaru, confounded by the worst news, cast an incredulous gaze towards Abel, who was still trying to continue. However, that gaze didn't work to stop Abel's words.</p>

            <p>In the tense atmosphere of the conference room, Abel continued on.</p>

            <p>That was--,</p>

            <p>"I expressed it as 'endlessly', but that is not accurate. No matter how extraordinary the mana that the 'Stone' possesses, it will eventually run out. When it does, the ground of the empire will find its end. --That's because the divine area protected by the 'Stone', the power that supports the land of Volachia, will lose its strength and won't be able to avoid crumbling,"</p>

            <p>--It was a message of disaster, revealing the true nature of the "Disaster" that will genuinely annihilate the Empire.</p>
