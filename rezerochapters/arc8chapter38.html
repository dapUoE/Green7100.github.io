        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>Rowan Segmund is a "Stargazer." This title has a different, original meaning, separate from the one Vincent Vollachia used when he began to employ one of theirs, Ubilk, as an official. A Stargazer is one who is bestowed with a divine mission to prioritize above all else in their lifetime, an existence that throws everything else aside to accomplish that supreme proposition.</p>

            <p>It can be presumed that Vincent deliberately allowed the title "Stargazer" to be associated with the official position held by Ubilk, planning for the term to gradually become a hollow shell, but the wise emperor's true intentions can be ignored here. What’s important is that Rowan Segmund, too, is one of those who have received a divine mission.</p>

            <p>For those who become Stargazers and are given a divine mission, the compulsion is strong. It grants the authority for a mere male prostitute to voice opinions directly to the emperor and to enter and exit the castle as they please, to make one forget the love for a daughter born at the risk of a frail mother's life, and to easily relinquish a purpose that one has spent their whole life on. Many SAtargazers have their previous lives twisted by their divine mission and are forced to change the way they live, yet they do not see it as a tragedy.</p>

            <p>Rather, they are given a great ambition that must be achieved even at the cost of their lives, and they can believe without a doubt that fulfilling it is the very reason for their existence, which can even be felt as happiness. No matter how abnormal or pitiable it may seem to those around them, it is still true.</p>

            <p>However, concerning the common tragedy among Stargazers, the position in which Rowan finds himself is exceptional, even among his peers. After all, the divine mission bestowed upon Rowan Segmund is to reach the "Heavenly Sword."</p>

            <p>—This was the very ambition Rowan himself had harbored long before he was given his divine mission.</p>

            <p>△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>"Honing the way of the sword, armed with steel through the years—"</p>

            <p>With a happy drunken sway, Rowan sings in a good mood, swaying his head from side to side. There's no particular tune, but he's in high spirits, unable to restrain from singing. His steps stagger like a dance, swaying agreeably.</p>

            <p>A while ago, just before the commotion of the "Black-Haired Crown Prince" began to stir, a nostalgic and fragrant scent of blood had started to float across the empire. Rowan had a premonition that it was a harbinger of war, and that following Vincent's unusually peaceful reign, there would be a significant upheaval.</p>

            <p>That premonition had come true, and now the empire is in a time of calamity where the boundary between the living and the dead is ambiguous.</p>

            <p>"Ah, how wonderful, a world to my liking," Rowan exclaimed.</p>

            <p>The more the world departs from peace and order is disturbed, the more the true nature of steel is polished. There's no need for deliberate honing; having enemies worth cutting down is all that's necessary. Yet, it's a fact that great warriors seldom raise their cries of life in times of peace.</p>

            <p>It's unclear where the soul comes from, but it seems to be ready before it settles into the flesh.</p>

            <p>Those born in chaotic times cry out with the talents to live through them. Therefore, it's a long shot to bet that the same soul will reside in those born during other times. Rowan has gambled and failed many times, and he only grasped Cecilus after taking eight of his children’s lives.</p>

            <p>Cecilus alone had smiled at the sight of the naked blade in his baptism, recognizing it as something he could love all his life.</p>

            <p>"But to have reached a plateau, Cecilus, the 'Heavenly Sword' is still far away. Oh dear, to think I was born in the wrong era," Rowan lamented, pressing his dry palm against his forehead, repeating a complaint he had made many times before.</p>

            <p>The more the world is troubled, the more times are tumultuous, the more the era demands the dominance of the mighty. If the path to the "Heavenly Sword" is to be so arduous and distant, how much better were the times four hundred years ago when everyone living feared the "Witch"? If he had been born in that era, there would have been no risk of the path to the "Heavenly Sword" being severed.</p>

            <p>Especially since Rowan hopes for Cecilus—</p>

            <p>"Oi, are you really serious about doing this?" came a voice from behind.</p>

            <p>"Uh-huh?"</p>

            <p>Turning around groggily, Rowan spots the speaker—a red-haired swordsman named Heinkel, looming large and staring down with an intense gaze. The man, who had until recently been drowning in drink with Rowan, now wore a completely sober face in stark contrast. Strangely, even though he should be cleaner than when they first picked him up in the wilds, he now looks more exhausted.</p>

            <p>"What a dismal air you have about you. Come on, red hair, have a drink. The streets are falling apart, but luckily, those corpse people don’t touch food or drink."</p>

            <p>"Luckily...?"</p>

            <p>"Oh, it seems I've offended you," Rowan remarked.</p>

            <p>Heinkel gritted his teeth and tensed his cheeks in response to Rowan, who is offering a gourd filled with alcohol. Rowan, taking the hint of rejection, empties the unwanted drink down his own throat. As Heinkel said, with stores and homes deserted and the dead wandering in search of the living, their concern is blood, not sustenance.</p>

            <p>"It's quite free, really. If it's just going to rot otherwise, better we should have it—makes perfect sense, doesn’t it?"</p>

            <p>"It's not about food or drink, that stuff doesn’t matter! It’s your—your family's sense of morality, I’m not expecting any better. Rather than that, answer me, are you serious about doing this?"</p>

            <p>"—"</p>

            <p>Heinkel, his voice harsh, was met with silence as Rowan half-closed one eye. Impatient and unable to wait even a few seconds, the red-haired swordsman clearly had an issue in mind, but it was somewhat difficult for Rowan to grasp what it was.</p>

            <p>Rowan has always struggled with understanding others' thoughts and feelings. The same flaw seems to have been passed down to Cecilus, albeit from a different angle where he bulldozes through issues. Rowan cannot do the same.</p>

            <p>In any case—</p>

            <p>"Are you worried about whether I'll go along with that helmeted fellow's plan or not, red hair?" Rowan asked.</p>

            <p>"Yes. I've returned by chance, but like Aldebaran said, this is an opportunity for redemption. I can’t screw this up," Heinkel confirmed with a nod.</p>

            <p>Pointing his finger towards the end of the street—and beyond, towards the massive castle walls looming in the distance and concealed from view within the imperial capital—he was alluding to the star-shaped walls that had served to protect the citizens from the rebels during the Imperial Capital Decisive Battle.</p>

            <p>"One of the five points we have to take down," Heinkel stated with a tense and somber voice.</p>

            <p>That was the path Aldebaran, the man they call Al, had marked down—the prelude following in the steps of the "Hero" that Rowan and the others in the imperial capital would tread.</p>

            <p>Currently, the only living souls on this street were Rowan and Heinkel, and fortunately, not a single corpse could be found. Cecilus, Groovy, and Al were on separate missions. They were all engaging in their tasks to bore a hole through the sturdy walls that protected the imperial capital.</p>

            <p>Rowan and Heinkel, along with Groovy, had employed rather unconventional means to make their way into the imperial capital. It would be difficult for others to emulate. Hence, the notion that they ought to create a passage was a proposal that made sense.</p>

            <p>Thus separated from his rather noisy, shrunken son, Heinkel’s intense fervor was anything but conducive to an easygoing journey for the two middle-aged men. Rowan scratched his cheek, pondering what to do.</p>

            <p>Heinkel clicked his tongue, clearly irritated, and began:
            "Honestly, I don’t understand the foreshadowing your son was talking about..."</p>

            <p>"Don't worry too much about how he says things,” Rowan waved him off. “Either way, there’s no mistake that we can't continue if that city wall is up and lively."</p>

            <p>"If you realize that...!"</p>

            <p>"—Why, then, do I choose not to cooperate immediately upon request?"</p>

            <p>Heinkel attempted to bark out his frustration, only for Rowan to cut him off with a shrug. The annoyance was plain on his face—a face that would be a perfect companion to a good drink, Rowan thought, though too much drinking wasn't advisable. Getting more drink around here would be a hassle, and there was no telling if the man before him might carelessly draw his sword in irritation.</p>

            <p>"I doubt the redhead would manage to draw his sword against someone like me."</p>

            <p>"——!" Heinkel’s response was a sharp intake of breath.</p>

            <p>"Ahh, it’s alright. There’s no shame in it. At least, I don't believe drawing a blade readily equates to bravery... As for whether something scares you or not, that I cannot say."</p>

            <p>Rowan tapped his own temple with a finger, alluding to a sober loss. Heinkel’s eyes went wide with surprise as Rowan looked towards the city walls.</p>

            <p>"The simple fact is that I have no desire to reclaim the imperial capital from the dead. That’s why I have no intention of cooperating with a plan to dismantle its defenses."</p>

            <p>That was Rowan's honest sentiment, but still, Heinkel looked back and forth, puzzled. Rowan believed he had given a rather clear answer and tilted his head in confusion.</p>

            <p>"Does that mean you’re siding with the cadavers, then?"</p>

            <p>"Why would you think that? That’s a different story altogether. I merely find the situation—the country in disarray from the undead rampaging—convenient. I'm certainly not on their side."</p>

            <p>"I can’t understand at all what you’re thinking. But..."</p>

            <p>"Yes?"</p>

            <p>"Even if you're not inclined, your son — 'The Blue Lightning' — he seems eager. Are you just going to overlook that?"</p>

            <p>With a hand to his mouth, Heinkel processed the information he was being force-fed. The topic Heinkel brought up next, however, was irrelevant to Rowan.</p>

            <p>Indeed, Cecilus did seem enthusiastic about Al's plan.
            "I am me, and my son is my son. It's as simple as that. Besides..."</p>

            <p>"Besides?"</p>

            <p>"With Cecilus as he is now, 'The Sword Saint' is but a distant peak. Shrinking might dull the swordsmanship. He wouldn’t be able to fulfill the promise he made when he cut me."</p>

            <p>"———"</p>

            <p>With a light touch to his chest, Rowan remembered the sword wound that had been inflicted upon him, the bitter episode "The Attempted Assassination of The Emperor," as recounted by Groovy. Having been on the side that pushed Cecilus towards the deed, it could be considered incitement to assassination. At any rate, the failed attempt left Rowan with a cut that remained a stark reminder, not allowing him to forget the searing moment of impact.</p>

            <p>But as he reflected on this, Rowan suddenly cocked his head.
            "But redhead, you seem quite caught up in the discussion about me and my son. When I think about it, you had the deepest reaction. Is there something you're hiding?"</p>

            <p>Heinkel's reactions to both Cecilus' shrunken state and the fact that Rowan was the father, both in his larger and smaller forms, were dull and heavy.</p>

            <p>When Rowan pressed him for the true meaning, an unexpected answer came back:</p>

            <p>"...My name is Heinkel Astrea."</p>

            <p>"Astrea... Astrea, Astrea, Astrea... Oh, oh wow!"</p>

            <p>Rowan's eyes widened dramatically after repeating the name Heinkel had given with such gravitas.</p>

            <p>At first, Rowan had chewed over the name, letting it sit on his tongue for a while before any certainty seeped into his mind. But once that affirmation had fully permeated, a fiery realization coursed through him.</p>

            <p>"Does that mean, redhead! You belong to the 'Sword Saint' bloodline?!"</p>

            <p>The Astrea family of the Kingdom of Lugunica was renowned, holding the strongest title within the realm and rumored by some even to be the strongest across all the four main countries.</p>

            <p>Most notably, the current "Sword Saint," Reinhard van Astrea, was a man whose existence was exceptional even among the prestigious Astrea lineage.</p>

            <p>"Can it truly be, redhead! You've posed as a Heinkel, but are you not the current 'Sword Saint'? This would imply relatives... no, a son! Your son is Reinhard! The father of the 'Sword Saint'! What an unexpected connection! What a curious and mysterious fate!"</p>

            <p>Reinhard was said to be of the same generation as Cecilus—or rather, the original Cecilus.</p>

            <p>This suggested that Heinkel, almost of an age with Rowan, must have some paternal relationship with Reinhard. And with that thought, Heinkel's crushed look of bitterness also became clearer to understand.</p>

            <p>Rowan and Heinkel were fathers to "The Blue Lightning" and "The Sword Saint" respectively.</p>

            <p>"But more importantly, aren't you the descendent of the line that reached 'The Sword Saint'?" Rowan questioned further.</p>

            <p>"……eh?"</p>

            <p>"The first 'Sword Saint,' Reid Astrea, is a name I recall well! Respect is due to those who have reached the pinnacle that all swordsmen aspire to, the transcendental 'Sword Saint.'"</p>

            <p>The title of "Sword Saint," a hallmark of the Astrea family's special distinction, and Reid Astrea as the first one to have reached the concept of "The Sword Saint," were considered the epitome and transcendence of swordsmanship.</p>

            <p>Thinking this, Rowan suddenly felt his previous attitude towards Heinkel was rudely inappropriate and wished to apologize. It was disrespectful to a descendent of "The Sword Saint" who attained "The Sword Saint" status.</p>

            <p>"My apologies, redhead, for any indiscretions until now. I had no idea that the kin of Reid Astrea, who achieved 'The Sword Saint,' had fallen on such... hard times."</p>

            <p>"———"</p>

            <p>Rowan bowed deeply, his hand on the hilt of his sword, but Heinkel gave no reply.</p>

            <p>Looking suspiciously up, Rowan saw Heinkel covering his face with his hand, shaking his head. After a long, disheartened sigh, Heinkel said:</p>

            <p>"...I get it. I finally understand. Fundamentally, you and I, we are different."</p>

            <p>"Everything is quite muddled, but don't let it get you down too much. I am who I am, the son is his own, and the redhead is the redhead. No matter what, apart from piercing with steel, one cannot cut deeply," said the man heartily.</p>

            <p>"――I survived that ordeal thanks to you. For that much, I'm grateful," another replied with a solemn nod.</p>

            <p>With a gesture that seemed to refuse further exchange, Heinkel turned his back on Rowan.</p>

            <p>For a moment, Rowan felt an urge to strike at that diligent back, but knowing that Heinkel was not the sort to draw his weapon unless his life was in danger, he abstained from a senseless killing.</p>

            <p>A pointless kill would only tarnish the steel.</p>

            <p>Heinkel likely continued towards the designated summit, presumably engaging in sabotage. It was unclear if he had calculated the presence of any adept opposition that might immobilize him, and if he was relying on Rowan, then apologies were owed.</p>

            <p>However, Rowan had his own purpose, one that did not prioritize his relationship with Heinkel, not in the slightest.</p>

            <p>Thus, though parting with a drinking companion saddened him, it was time to say goodbye――,</p>

            <p>"You leave your son behind; what is it you're seeking to achieve?"</p>

            <p>On the verge of departing, Rowan could only offer a bitter smile at Heinkel's question, still with his back turned. His face and the look in his eyes betrayed no hint of the impression of a man wallowing in sentimentality. Without hesitation to the question, Rowan slapped the sword wound on his chest, declaring,</p>

            <p>"Of course, for my own fervent wish. ―― Just like you, the redhead."</p>

            <p>If it were about leaving behind his son, that aspect was the same for Heinkel too.</p>

            <p>Not caring in the least about Heinkel's reaction, Rowan started running briskly towards his goal through the deserted imperial capital, empty of the living.</p>

            <p>△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>――Now, Rowan Segmund is "Star Reader."</p>

            <p>He would swear upon his honor that before Rowan became a "Star Reader," before he was engrossed in fulfilling a heaven-sent destiny, he had his personality, hopes, and a life.</p>

            <p>Naturally, just like the majority of "Star Readers," upon receiving his heavenly duty and becoming one of them, Rowan was compelled to live differently than before. However, the changes in Rowan went largely unnoticed by those around him.</p>

            <p>That was because, even before receiving his heavenly duty, Rowan Segmund's ardent desire had been to reach the "Sword of Heaven," and he was fervently devoted to anything that might contribute to that goal.</p>

            <p>Rowan clashed swords with mighty warriors who also aimed to perfect their skills, with fearsome beasts that attacked villages, with villagers barely surviving the onslaught of beasts, with villains who oppressed others, and with saints who bestowed aid upon others. He cut through them all, seeking to forge his steel, yet much progress was not seen.</p>

            <p>He studied various schools, mastered their techniques, even defeated their masters, attempting to integrate the vast array of skills he absorbed. But realizing it only disrupted the balance of his own techniques, he abandoned that approach too.</p>

            <p>Literally walking a bloodied path, yearning with all his heart for the "Sword of Heaven," he once considered ending his own life―― That was when it happened.</p>

            <p>The moment Rowan received his heavenly duty, becoming a "Star Reader."</p>

            <p>No matter what, he was destined to strive for the "Sword of Heaven," not to reach it himself, but to create the path for others to achieve it. This became his trial and error.</p>

            <p>But the correct answer was elusive. Basically, Rowan's work was always the same.</p>

            <p>The only way was to try everything possible. Quickly he abandoned the method of spotting talent and nurturing it to success.</p>

            <p>He concluded it was better to do things himself, for if he couldn’t do better than others, the "Sword of Heaven" would remain nothing but a dream. Better to cut such fleeting hopes away.</p>

            <p>In time, he realized. He was seen as suitable for the "Sword of Heaven" for a reason, for his very own being.</p>

            <p>Reconsidering, he attempted to aim for the "Sword of Heaven" himself, but abandoned the blind pursuit and random slaying.</p>

            <p>No, not for Rowan himself to reach. ――If Rowan’s seed could reach it, that would suffice.</p>

            <p>Thus, after relentless effort from Rowan Segmund, a vessel capable of reaching the "Sword of Heaven," Cecilus Segmund, was born, and Rowan fulfilled his role.</p>

            <p>Bathing in the newborn waters, he watched his child, who laughed merrily while pressing a glinting blade to Rowan's neck, and felt liberated from the long, constricting bonds that held him.</p>

            <p>A "Star Reader" is released from their given role upon witnessing the accomplishment of their heavenly task.</p>

            <p>When liberation comes from what has dictated one's mind―prior values, beliefs, and convictions, even in the absence of reason, gravitate toward incomprehension.</p>

            <p>Of course, the same happened to Rowan.</p>

            <p>Desperate to create a child with the talent to reach the "Sword of Heaven," once born, the thought of that achievement rendered everything irrelevant.</p>

            <p>Thus, he was left with a son acknowledged with the potential to reach the "Sword of Heaven" and himself, who had lost sight of that aim and sacrificed his prime for others.</p>

            <p>Faced with this unbearably harsh reality, Rowan once again set his mind toward the decision to end his life, a step he didn’t previously take.</p>

            <p>But――,</p>

            <p>"Ah!"</p>

            <p>As his life-threatening blade was laughed off, and his son, guaranteed to walk the path of the "Sword of Heaven" from birth, gripped Rowan's finger amidst his despair, the thought completely vanished.</p>

            <p>The shock that this frail life brought to Rowan was immeasurable, even having ended countless lives and bathed in enough blood to form lakes.</p>

            <p>He realized then.</p>

            <p>If this fragile being would eventually gain the suitable sword power to reach the "Sword of Heaven," what reason was there to view his future as solely a decline past his prime?</p>

            <p>If an infant could reach the "Sword of Heaven," then even an aging swordsman still has a path before him.</p>

            <p>Therefore, Rowan cast aside the sorrow that sealed his way, and promised to forge ahead with his own wishes once more.</p>

            <p>Having received and fulfilled his heavenly task, birthing a child capable of reaching the "Sword of Heaven" and thus freed from his role as a "Star Reader,"</p>

            <p>――Rowan Segmund is still not giving up on the path that leads to the "Sword of Heaven," persisting in his journey.</p>

            <p>△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>Parting with Heinkel and with caution quickening his step, Rowan made for the northern side of the imperial capital.</p>

            <p>Ahead lay the Crystal Palace, the most prominent structure within the capital and now undoubtedly a stronghold for the undead.</p>

            <p>It was probable that the ringleader responsible for reviving the dead, as surmised by Groovy and Al, was within the castle. But this did not deter Rowan's pace.</p>

            <p>The goal was not to storm the castle and be the first to decapitate the enemy's leader in order to resolve the situation, but let it be stated clearly: he did not head for the Crystal Palace for that purpose.</p>

            <p>The words conveyed to Heinkel were wholly devoid of falsehood; Rowan scarcely cared whether the empire was saved or not. If anything, he recognized that the greater the chaos and calamity, the better.</p>

            <p>There was certainly a reason why Rowan, indifferent to the fate of the empire, was hurrying frantically to the Crystal Palace.</p>

            <p>Obviously, the reason was his own flesh and blood, Cecilus Segmund. However, even mentioning Cecilus as a reason didn't entail a tale of paternal love or affection.</p>

            <p>"That halfwit, to think he'd relinquish the 'Dream Sword' and 'Evil Sword,' that's utterly inconceivable."</p>

            <p>Grinding his teeth, Rowan envisioned those two blades of tremendous power in his mind's eye—there were many so-called cursed or holy swords in the world, but truly powerful swords numbered only ten. Amongst them were Cecilus's beloved blades, Masayume, the "Dream Sword," which had been downsized and let go, and Murasame, the "Evil Sword."</p>

            <p>Under no circumstances could those two swords be lost. In order to attain "Heaven's Sword," it goes without saying that the person's own skill and swordsmanship must be exceptional, but one also cannot compromise on the steel that proves these qualities as genuine to the world. Masayume and Murasame were indeed the two blades worthy of this designation.</p>

            <p>"Who knows when he'll return to his original size, but a swordsman needs his swords to be presentable, doesn't he?"</p>

            <p>When the diminished Cecilus returns to his original stature, it would be out of the question not to have his swords. Or perhaps, in the midst of this great and troubling time, Cecilus might reach the level of "Heaven's Sword." If that moment came and Cecilus was without his swords, the consequences would be dire.</p>

            <p>Even if Cecilus were to reach "Heaven's Sword," cutting him down without the perfect blade in his possession would not prove Rowan's ascension to “Heaven’s Sword.”</p>

            <p>For the sake of that proof, Cecilus must reclaim his swords.</p>

            <p>"That bastard, to think he's shrunk and forgotten the promise to his father, what an insolent fool."</p>

            <p>Once upon a time, there was a promise made between Rowan and Cecilus. When Rowan intended to swiftly make the entire empire an enemy to propel Cecilus toward "Heaven's Sword," Cecilus unexpectedly refused, citing it as 'crude villainy,' and set out to cut down Rowan with Vincent's help.</p>

            <p>At that moment, Rowan offered a promise for Cecilus to spare his life.</p>

            <p>One day, should Cecilus attain "Heaven's Sword," Rowan would surely come to strike him down.</p>

            <p>Cecilus agreed, tossed the seriously wounded Rowan into the river to escape, and though Rowan nearly died, he survived. He honed his skills while awaiting the promised time.</p>

            <p>And now, that time seemed to be drawing near.</p>

            <p>"If the location hasn't changed..."</p>

            <p>While occupying the seat of the "First," Cecilus spent most of his reward on swords. He never possessed a residence befitting a general and chose to live modestly, constructing a cabin on the northern fields of the Crystal Palace. If nothing had changed, it was highly likely that the two swords, "Dream Sword" and "Evil Sword," were stored in that cabin.</p>

            <p>To recover them and deliver them to Cecilus, Rowan had to venture into the depths of the Crystal Palace.</p>

            <p>"――!"</p>

            <p>Sidestepping the gazes of the corpses, he bypassed the Crystal Palace and was about to head to the base of the destroyed flood barrier when an unexpected presence made Rowan leap sideward.</p>

            <p>And it was the right move.</p>

            <p>With a tremendous impact, something crashed from above, causing a vicious collapse that carved a crater into the avenue.</p>

            <p>The walls encircling the perimeter of the Crystal Palace facing the street twisted and crumbled, a cloud of dust billowed out like an explosion, filling the view, and with a click of his tongue, Rowan drew his sword from its sheath.</p>

            <p>A cutting strike in the manner of Kumo-Kiri cleared the dust cloud, revealing the cause of the impact on the other side.</p>

            <p>A slender, tall woman stood there. Her long, white hair flowed freely, her body draped in an elegant blue dress. Though Rowan was hardly attuned to judgments of beauty, her lithe form would be deemed beautiful according to his own standards.</p>

            <p>The sorrow residing in her elongated blue eyes puzzled Rowan.</p>

            <p>Unlike the corpse-like beings with black eyes and golden pupils she showed signs of life. Blood coursed through her pale skin, and the woman's gaze, seemingly alive, was fixated on him.</p>

            <p>But this was a city of the dead, the corpses' domain, and her actions should be that of an enemy to the living.</p>

            <p>"Who might you be――"</p>

            <p>"――Iris."</p>

            <p>"...Didn't expect you to offer your name so readily."</p>

            <p>Maintaining his sword at the ready by his side, Rowan moistened his lips with his tongue and narrowed his eyes.</p>

            <p>Although she was a woman, that was no reason to underestimate her. Above all, the aura enveloping her was unmistakably that of a formidable opponent. Her expression wasn't one of someone who wielded their power with a positive intent, but that was a trivial matter to Rowan.</p>

            <p>In the face of what seemed like an undue fixation, the woman who introduced herself as Iris twitched her fox ears hidden amidst her white hair.</p>

            <p>"You must return. While under my watch, no one needs to die."</p>

            <p>"Well, I am truly sorry about that."</p>

            <p>Making a fervent appeal, Rowan closed an eye in front of the woman—named Iris—and tightened his grip on the sword. No matter what the opponent's intentions, if they obstructed his path, it was inevitable. Moreover, backing away in the presence of such a mighty adversary was unthinkable for a swordsman.</p>

            <p>Thus――,</p>

            <p>"――The path to 'Heaven's Sword' remains treacherous. I must cut you down to proceed."</p>
