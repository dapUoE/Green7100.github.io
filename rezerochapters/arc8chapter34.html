        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>The morning of departure to the Imperial Capital Lupgana had arrived.</p>

            <p>At the entrance of the fortress city of Garkla, refugees from The Capital and its surroundings continued to arrive this morning, swelling to a number that could not be accommodated even in a city that could accommodate a large number of people.</p>

            <p>While everyone was busy dealing with that situation, unfortunately, it was a problem that those who were not related to the empire could not intervene.</p>

            <p>Therefore, they have to do their assigned jobs properly.</p>

            <p>They must do it properly,</p>

            <p>"It's very, very painful... but I can't be of help," said the peach-haired boy, his shoulders drawn tight with regret. Emilia could feel the pain he was going through, and she clenched her fists.</p>

            <p>Emilia knows too well the pain of not being able to do what she wants to do because she doesn't have enough power.</p>

            <p>Moreover, this boy - Schult is a young child. Emilia has also had a time when she was small and could not be with someone important to her.</p>

            <p>That's why she understood Schult's feelings all too well.</p>

            <p>"Please, Lady Emilia. I beg you, please help Lady Priscilla, Mister Al, and Master Heinkel."</p>

            <p>With his round eyes full of tears, Schult pleaded with Emilia.</p>

            <p>For such a small child to have to ask someone to help the people he loves while holding back tears takes a lot of courage.</p>

            <p>It's something Emilia couldn't do. That's why she respects Schult's courage.</p>

            <p>And she will bring back a different ending for Schult than what happened to Emilia back then.</p>

            <p>"Alright, leave it to me. Thank you for asking me."</p>

            <p>"Lady Emilia…"</p>

            <p>"But with this, no matter what Priscilla says to keep me away, I can argue back that I was asked properly!"</p>

            <p>Emilia confidently pats her chest, saying that to reassure Schult.</p>

            <p>Hearing this, Schult widened his already round eyes, and soon brightened up, saying,</p>

            <p>"Yes! Lady Priscilla is not straightforward, so I want you to argue back for me!"</p>

            <p>Even if he's just putting a brave face on, Schult has regained some life in his voice. In response to his words, Emilia responds with a firm 'Yes!' and nods.</p>

            <p>"Hmm, you're dependable. But also reckless. Beako should keep an eye on you."</p>

            <p>"There's no need for you to tell me that, you know. I'm fully aware."</p>

            <p>During this exchange between Emilia and Schult, two young girls of shorter stature were speaking beside them. Emilia's companion, Beatrice, and Schult's attendant, Utakata. Satisfied with watching Emilia and Schult's exchange, they glance at each other and say,</p>

            <p>"Even over here, there's hardly any relief. I guess it's best to stay hidden, worriedly clutching our heads like that Schult boy?"</p>

            <p>"When push comes to shove, Utakata will fight to protect Schult. Beatrice, do your best with Subaru."</p>

            <p>"... Really, it's reassuring, isn't it?"</p>

            <p>Thus, despite their visual differences and an age gap in their inner selves, the two girls swore their mutual struggle, exchanging resolutions for the battle that would determine the fate of the Vollachian Empire.</p>

            <p>△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>And in a slightly separate location--,</p>

            <p>"I'm off now, Brother! And Sister Serena!"</p>

            <p>This was boldly announced in an energetic, high-pitched voice by Medium, who turned a brave smile toward the two who were seeing her off.</p>

            <p>Medium, who was joining the assault party into the capital, was seen off by her older brother Flop and her old, greatly indebted benefactor they had reunited with on the battlefield, Serena Dracroy.</p>

            <p>Serena, who had looked after Flop and Medium since their childhood, sent off Medium-- who was heading into battle-- the same way she had when the sibling pair had set off on their journey to independence from her more than five years ago, her beautiful features unchanged, white scar on her face included.</p>

            <p>"Who would've thought that not only would Medium surpass my height, but even try to surpass my position. If you successfully become Abel's bride, please remember this favor."</p>

            <p>“Geez, I’m trying not to think about that for now! Besides, I can't even think about Abel when I'm going to see Brother Bal!"</p>

            <p>"That's true. You were never one to multitask. Therefore..."</p>

            <p>Slowly, Serena walks over and gently places her hand on Medium's cheek.</p>

            <p>Serena was tall for a woman, but Medium was even taller. However, in the presence of the woman who reached out to her, Medium could go back to how she felt when she was a girl. On the day of her departure, Serena touched Medium's face in the same way. She touched the white scar, gently tracing it with her finger.</p>

            <p>"I envy you, for being able to wish for a conversation without hesitation."</p>

            <p>"Serena..."</p>

            <p>"With both Bal and Miles, I missed the chance to exchange last words. It seems I won't get a chance to speak with Bal this time either... I don't know if that's painful or relieving, even I can't figure it out. It's not like I'm usually afraid of anything."</p>

            <p>The impression Medium had of Serena was of a woman who knew no fear. Indeed, even when she wrested the family headship from her own father, and had to bear a lifelong scar on her face because of his spiteful scream, Serena didn't change her expression, it was heard.</p>

            <p>"That's a lie. It hurt and my father's words were harsh. Blood flowed instead of tears."</p>

            <p>"Huh? I wonder about that. When it really hurts, don't tears flow along with the blood? In that case, Count Dracroy wasn't crying, was she...?”</p>

            <p>"Shut up, be quiet."</p>

            <p>Flop who tilted his head in confusion was silenced by the cold voice. Serena, still touching Medium's face, looked at her affectionately, narrowing her eyes.</p>

            <p>"My facial scar was something I had to get in order to be reborn. I don't wish for the same on your face, but I do hope that you can gain something."</p>

            <p>"Okay. Serena, is there anything you want to tell Bal? I'll definitely pass it on."</p>

            <p>"-. Yes."</p>

            <p>Serena fell silent for a moment at Medium's resolve to deliver the message, pondering. But the clever woman quickly returned an answer to Medium's question. What she wanted to tell Baru was—</p>

            <p>"– Go to sleep already. Miles is complaining about being bored without you."</p>

            <p>That was a message full of feelings from Serena, harsh but with love, for someone who was not quite a subordinate nor a younger brother.</p>

            <p>△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>"– Schwarz, it's the worst scenario, but I won't blame you if you don't come back."</p>

            <p>"Hey, hey."</p>

            <p>Looking seriously at Subaru, Idra made his statement which made Subaru's eyes go wide in surprise. He was about to immediately retort with "Don't joke at a time like this," but Idra's intense gaze didn't falter, so he lost the opportunity to do so.</p>

            <p>In Subaru's place, Hiain raised his voice in frustration, "Don't talk nonsense!" The Lizardman shot a fierce glance at Idra with surprisingly round eyes,</p>

            <p>"Hey, hey, what are you saying?! You're okay with not coming back?! You're not telling our brother to die, are you?!"</p>

            <p>"If I fear misunderstanding, then yes."</p>

            <p>"What!? There's no misunderstanding!? You're a traitor! We have a traitor among us! Brother, what happened, this is bad!"</p>

            <p>"Calm down, Hiain. Idra saying something like this is strange. This doesn't make sense."</p>

            <p>Idra hung his head low in front of an aggressive Hiain. He had a seriously grim look on his face. Still, Subaru wasn't going to just accept Idra's words without question. Furthermore, his relationship with Idra wasn't supposed to be like this.</p>

            <p>"So, why did you say that? Tell us why."</p>

            <p>"...I met with Emperor Vincent alongside Governor Gustav. That's when I heard it. I asked the Emperor about what he intended to do with Schwarz."</p>

            <p>Holding his fist tightly, Idra bitterly relayed his story, to which Subaru responded, "Oh".</p>

            <p>He had heard that Governor Gustav was going to speak with Abel last night, but this is the first time he heard that Idra was also there and that Idra had dropped such a huge bombshell. However, if Idra was there, then it's a natural question.</p>

            <p>Originally, the members of the "Pleiades Battalion" were gathered for the purpose of punching Vincent Vollachia, the Emperor, in the face, with Subaru at the center. The zombie panic made that goal vague, but once the problem was resolved, they had to settle the civil war. That being said, directly questioning Abel required a lot of courage.</p>

            <p>"Is that... true? So, what did the Emperor say he would do about Schwarz?"</p>

            <p>"His Majesty, the Emperor, said that whether Schwarz lives or dies depends on his actions..."</p>

            <p>"He must be joking...! That's just up to the Emperor's mood then!"</p>

            <p>Hearing the story that Idra brought back, Hiain's voice trembled in anger. Subaru could envision the figure of Abel, who had uttered those words, and could surmise his general intentions, but to those who did not know Abel's character, it might sound like an excuse to dispose of Subaru after the war for whatever reason.</p>

            <p>"So, you're telling me to die?"</p>

            <p>"Huh? You, in other words, you're betraying your brothers and siding with the emperor..."</p>

            <p>"No, you're saying I should pretend to do that and get away, right?"</p>

            <p>Subaru cut off Hiain, who was taking his words too literally, and Idra nodded at this.</p>

            <p>Idra cast his eyes down regretfully,</p>

            <p>"The emperor was the one who managed to unite the imperial citizens in the midst of the confusion caused by the resurrection of the dead. The seeds of discontent that led to civil unrest will surely wither once this situation is brought under control. ...If he survives, Emperor Vincent's reign is secure."</p>

            <p>"What if my brother accomplishes something big!? Like, taking down the enemy's leader..."</p>

            <p>"That would still be tough. He may receive a commendation from the emperor and then be left to die slowly, possibly assassinated once the heat dies down."</p>

            <p>"This is too cruel, even for the Vollachian Empire..."</p>

            <p>The fact that the thoughts of Idra and Hiain are not an overreaction, shows the national character of the empire.</p>

            <p>At least, I would like to hope that the treatment of Abel in the future will soften somewhat, but it will be difficult to change Idra and the others' perception at this point.</p>

            <p>However, despite his apologies to the considerate Idra and the solution-seeking Hiain,</p>

            <p>"Faking my death is not an option. Of course, actually dying is also out. I'll definitely come back. There are things I have to tell everyone."</p>

            <p>"Subaru..."</p>

            <p>"Don't make such a serious face. I'm not sure everything will work out perfectly... but I think we can avoid the worst-case scenario."</p>

            <p>In any case, the basic premise of the "succession battle" that Idra and the others are most concerned about will collapse.</p>

            <p>It's a concern how his relationship with the members of the group will turn out after that, but all Subaru can do is convey his sincere apology.</p>

            <p>"I'll definitely come back. - So let's stop sneaking into the wagon, Weitz."</p>

            <p>"Guh..."</p>

            <p>As Subaru called out in this way, a muffled voice could be heard.</p>

            <p>Having no idea where the voice had come from, both Idra and Hiain hurriedly glanced around their surroundings. Subaru sighed and crouched down.</p>

            <p>Behind where Subaru and his companions were speaking, there stood a carriage intended to transport the assault team. Underneath the carriage's body and clutched onto the shaft of its running wheels was a man with a tattoo, a picture of a skull etched into his body.</p>

            <p>Weitz reluctantly came forth from his hiding spot,</p>

            <p>"No matter how much the 'Divine Protection of Wind Evasion' mitigates the shaking, if you cling onto such a place for a whole day, you're normally going to fall and die."</p>

            <p>"I entrusted my life to you....If I die for you, it's more than I can wish for..."</p>

            <p>"Just because you die without anyone knowing, doesn't mean you died for me!"</p>

            <p>Weitz, his sense of camaraderie misdirected, clicked his tongue at Subaru's remark.</p>

            <p>Then, Hiain and Idra both stepped forward,</p>

            <p>"You, you promised to safeguard our siblings' home! Don't try to jump the gun, you backstabbing bastard!"</p>

            <p>"Shut up, don't compare me with that beard guy over there...!"</p>

            <p>"Stop treating me like a traitor! You know that's not true!"</p>

            <p>"Calm down! Stop fussing! Get along!"</p>

            <p>Scolding the three who began arguing in their usual rhythm, Subaru put his hand on his hip.
            Yes, they were members who had gotten used to their usual rhythm. However, they must be left in the fortress city to prepare for the battle against the coming swarm of zombies.</p>

            <p>Strong and sturdy, their font for survival now makes them the foremost group in the empire. In a fight against zombies -- who neither kill nor be killed -- there are no more reliable forces than the Pleiades Battalion.</p>

            <p>"I'm counting on all of you here. I have many precious companions. Unlike you guys, they can't fight... quite a number of them can't fight."</p>

            <p>"Speak in a clearer way!"</p>

            <p>In his mind, Subaru pictured Rem and Ram, who would be left in the city. It's false to say that they can't fight at all, but they're not exactly members who don't need to worry about battles. Subaru's unclear answer is a result of thinking in such a way.</p>

            <p>To this, Hiain raised his voice sharply, making Subaru grin wryly.</p>

            <p>"That's right, it's not a matter of being able to fight or not, it's that I don't want them to fight. That's where you guys differ. Fight to your heart's content!"</p>

            <p>"…That is sincere trust, and you should accept that," He spoke, locking eyes with Hiain and Idra, before finally settling his gaze on Weitz. Arms crossed, Weitz was silent with his eyes closed, the skull tattoo on his arm making him appear intimidating.</p>

            <p>After a moment of thought, he unfolded his arms slowly and said, "...under...stand...under... stand."</p>

            <p>"Satisfy me with your understanding!"</p>

            <p>"I understand..." Weitz chimed in, seeming to grimace at the difficulty of his decision but ultimately agreeing with Subaru's plan. With that, he slowly reached out his arm toward Subaru, placing a hand on his shoulder. Then, in an unusually gentle voice, he said, "You promised to come back, brother."</p>

            <p>"Oh!" Catching Subaru by surprise, he quickly flashed a smile and nod in response, "Understood, brother," he replied - wanting to reciprocate not just the offered hand, but the trust it signified.</p>

            <p>Hearing Subaru's response, Weitz smiled in satisfaction. But then—</p>

            <p>"Oi, oi, oi, oi! Stop imitating my way of calling others, you thieving bastard!"</p>

            <p>"You're just calling out as you please... I'm responding to Schwarz..." The banter began again, their squabble escalating, despite their previous agreement. "Stop it, both of you!!" shouted Subaru, as he was once again drawn into the midst of their arguing brothers, ruefully savouring the moment of parting.</p>

            <p>△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>"You should understand the role you have to play. Whether you continue to live even after the battle depends on how you work. Don't ever forget that."</p>

            <p>"Ah-uh-uh"</p>

            <p>Nodding in what seemed sincere understanding, the girl received a wink from Vincent.</p>

            <p>The power held by the Archbishop of Sin, Natsuki Subaru's walking accomplice – the girl with such an outrageous reputation – was the perfect remedy to the incessantly-reviving dead.</p>

            <p>Even if it was true, incorporating the cooperation of the Sin Archbishop into their strategy was unprecedented, even for the off-track Vollachian Empire.</p>

            <p>To begin with, being in a situation to draw out the Archbishop's cooperation was an unimaginable premise.</p>

            <p>"Your Excellency! The dragon carriages are ready! If all goes well, even without the chain dragon carriages, it shouldn't take long to reach the Imperial Capital!!"</p>

            <p>From beyond the mountain, as if he could be heard, came the voice of Goz, reaching Vincent, who was facing that girl—Spica. Naturally, he was not beyond the mountain and was by Vincent's side, so his volume was excessively loud.
            Anyways—,</p>

            <p>"When we get there, it won't do if "The Stone" has already exhausted its power. You too be strict with your orders. Do not take the lives of the undead in vain."</p>

            <p>"The fight without killing or dying is certainly unknown, but I will strive to make sure that your orders reach all of the soldiers! But..."</p>

            <p>With that, Goz cut off his sentence and clenched his fist, which was the size of a child's head. Even without looking at his profile, it was obvious that he was full of regret, distorting his face full of sword scars. 
            As expected, Goz’s stern voice, like the rumbling of the earth, trembled with frustration.</p>

            <p>"No matter how hard I try, I can't accompany you?"</p>

            <p>"Uh."</p>

            <p>The appeal of Goz, which, although squeezed out, was too forceful, made Spica recoil as if she had felt the wind. Even Vincent felt the trembling sensation in the sound on his skin.</p>

            <p>Not only ranting with his beloved hammer spear, Goz's volume alone could shake the world.</p>

            <p>"However, the decision is irrevocable regardless of your lament."</p>

            <p>"Your Excellency!"</p>

            <p>"Without you, either Count Dracroy or the duo of Zikr Osman and Berstetz can command. Both can be trusted with a battlefield, but a large-scale war is different."</p>

            <p>"That is..."</p>

            <p>"Now that Chisha is gone, there is no one else to whom I can entrust the entire army. Accept that."</p>

            <p>At Vincent's statement, Goz's eyes bulged out and his body stiffened.</p>

            <p>Berstetz was a civil servant, and while Serena was competent as a count, she was not a soldier. Zikr did not have the experience of commanding such a large army--there was no one but Goz who could take overall command. That was Vincent's evaluation, without any flattery.</p>

            <p>"I will entrust all the soldiers to you. Think of your sturdy shoulders bearing the survival of the empire.”</p>

            <p>With those straight-forward words, spoken by Vincent while gazing firmly at Goz.</p>

            <p>Upon hearing this, Goz shut his eyes tightly, casting aside his doubts with that single blink of his eyes. Lodging an appropriate ferocity into his eyes as is fitting for the "lion knight," Goz makes a pledge to Vincent with his fists and palms joined in front of his chest.</p>

            <p>"――. Goz Ralfon, I will follow your instructions!"</p>

            <p>"A great cause"</p>

            <p>"Haha!!"</p>

            <p>The short spoken Vincent pulled back his chin, and Goz deeply bowed his head to him. Undoubtedly, Goz would yearn to swing his strong arms in protection while accompanying Vincent. But, Goz had to swallow such feelings and instead――,</p>

            <p>"Take good care, Aurélie of the Trias! Protect his highness at all costs!"</p>

            <p>"Oh, leave it to me, Ralfon of the Trias! If I've been chosen, I'll fulfill my duty properly!"</p>

            <p>The one who was entrusted by Goz and energetically pounded his chest was Jamal. Having been nominated as a bodyguard by Vincent, and also entrusted with this task by Goz, he released a coarse smile while breathing heavily through his nostrils. Technically, the Aurélie house is of lower rank nobility, and such nobiliary grace is entirely lacking. But――,</p>

            <p>"That's the spirit! That is, a soldier of the Vollachian Empire!!"</p>

            <p>As Goz proudly chested out to send him off, that attitude was the way of Vollachia. In this view, indeed, the difficult to deal with Subaru and others of the kingdom, could only be called inappropriate personnel, even if they could understand or empathize.</p>

            <p>"Do not turn into a useless tool at the last minute,"</p>

            <p>"Uhh, ow"</p>

            <p>While exchaging loud voices with Goz and Jamal, Vincent turned his gaze towards Spica who was covering her ears, and thus announced. At Vincent's words, Spica puckered her lips in a frown.</p>

            <p>For some reason, it overlapped with Medium's expression from last night, when she was cautioning Vincent's words and actions, and Vincent ended up sighing. And so――.</p>

            <p>△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>The departing dragon carriages were three in number- a personnel count that seemed far less when compared to those entering the fortress city by beast carriage or on foot.</p>

            <p>However, it was undeniably these people who were being dispatched in hopes of preventing the "Great Disaster" that struck the Vollachian Empire- or rather, the "Great Disaster" which was about to bring about the Empire's downfall.</p>

            <p>Each one of them was shouldering strong resolution and the expectations of the masses. They would return to the Imperial Capital that turned into a city of the dead, and there defeat the ringleader of this disaster, the "Witch" known as Sphinx.</p>

            <p>That was――,</p>

            <p>"...... I can't believe big brother is one of the members, it feels like a lie."</p>

            <p>By the window, pushing her wheelchair, Katya gazed down at the view and muttered. Hearing that, Rem, who was by her side, lowered the corners of her eyes.</p>

            <p>Katya's older brother, Jamal, was one of the people heading to the Imperial Capital Lupgana as a bodyguard for Abel.</p>

            <p>As far as Rem was concerned, her memories of meeting him weren't particularly pleasant. But because he was Katya's brother, she couldn't be overly rude to him, which made him a difficult person to deal with.</p>

            <p>However, he seemed to be trusted by Abel, since he was chosen to be a bodyguard in the final stages.</p>

            <p>"Brother is simple. Easy to manage, or easy to be used as a pawn, he was chosen for that reason."</p>

            <p>"I don't think Abel is that cruel..."</p>

            <p>"I wonder. At least, that's my brother's intention...and you heard what he said yesterday, right?"</p>

            <p>"Eh, that is...yes."</p>

            <p>Under Katya's upturned gaze, Rem could not dodge the question and nodded.</p>

            <p>Last night, Jamal, who had visited Katya, said, laughing, that he had been chosen as Abel's bodyguard and was going to accompany him to the Imperial Capital.</p>

            <p>"Don't worry, Katya. I'll serve His Excellency, die a spectacular death! That way, even without that guy Todd, you won't have trouble with money!"</p>

            <p>"It seemed like he had no ill intent."</p>

            <p>"Well, even if there's no ill intent, there are still things that are wrong... why do people like my brother and Todd take their lives for granted?"</p>

            <p>Probably, in his own way, Jamal was thinking about his younger sister Katya's future. But she sincerely hoped he would consider Katya's feelings before her livelihood.</p>

            <p>After losing Todd, her fiancé, Katya would truly be alone if she lost Jamal, her own brother as well.</p>

            <p>There was something that Rem, even as a friend by her side, could not fill.</p>

            <p>"I also thought the same thing when I met my sister again..."</p>

            <p>Since Rem had no "memories", meeting Ram was like meeting for the first time.</p>

            <p>However, even without the "memories", Ram's existence was something that Rem’s "soul" remembered. It made her realize that she wasn’t alone in this world.</p>

            <p>For Katya, Jamal should have been such an existence as well.</p>

            <p>But the fact that Jamal was thinking like that, was due to the rough environment of the Empire.</p>

            <p>"Even if Abel-san becomes the Emperor, I can't say I particularly like the Empire..."</p>

            <p>"What a coincidence, I don't either. I don't really have a preference for any country or place."</p>

            <p>"As of now, I feel the same."</p>

            <p>Subaru and Rem's conversation indicated that Rem's hometown was the neighboring Kingdom of Lugunica. Competitive as Subaru was with his frequent disparagement of the Empire, the Kingdom must be somewhat more comfortable to live in. Even so...</p>

            <p>"When this battle ends..."</p>

            <p>Would she, herself, be going to that Kingdom? It would be hard to part with Ram, and she didn't doubt the story that the Kingdom was their original home. However, at present, the Empire was more familiar to Rem in terms of people and places. She couldn't quite envision herself completely settling down in a foreign kingdom.</p>

            <p>"...Rem, it looks like it's time to depart."</p>

            <p>Suddenly, Katya voiced these words to a contemplative Rem. Looking outside the window at her call, she saw three dragon-drawn carriages heading toward the Imperial Capital. Spica, Abel, and Subaru were on board.</p>

            <p>"Did you say your goodbyes properly?"</p>

            <p>"I spoke with them at breakfast. What about you, Katya-san...with your brother?"</p>

            <p>"I said everything I wanted to say. Even if he gets angry, it doesn't matter, I made sure to infuriate him"</p>

            <p>Katya turned away, her face scrunching in bitterness as she remembered the argument she had with Jamal. However, she had said everything she wanted to say to her brother who was heading into danger. As if often the case, Katya directed her gaze towards Rem,</p>

            <p>"Were you able to say all that you wanted to say?"</p>

            <p>"...What I wanted to say, you ask?"</p>

            <p>"You seem to be a bit sulky."</p>

            <p>After receiving a rather unflattering assessment, Rem blinked in surprise. Being sulky was similar to a child throwing a tantrum. Rem didn't feel she was sulking as Katya said.</p>

            <p>"There's nothing to be sulky about..."</p>

            <p>"As long as that's true."</p>

            <p>"-----"</p>

            <p>With her lip firmly pressed to keep silent at the piercing comment, Rem faultered at Katya's words. Her statement made it seem as if Rem was lying. She wasn't sulking, and there was no reason for her to say any more than she already had.</p>

            <p>After all, Subaru was also with Emilia and Beatrice.</p>

            <p>Spica, Abel, and even that incredibly strong werewolf, Halibel, are accompanying us. It feels reassuring, being surrounded by such dependable individuals, there's no doubt. Therefore ────,
            
            "Um, I..."</p>

            <p>"───────"</p>

            <p>"I... regret."</p>

            <p>Facing away, with her gaze fixed only on Katya, Rem hesitantly moved her lips. There was no need to ask what it meant, what thoughts it was connected to.</p>

            <p>Tightly closing her eyes, Rem reached towards the window ──── where she and Katya had been looking at the scene below ──── and briskly threw it open. Immediately a refreshing, morning breeze flowed into the fortress room, caressing Rem's blue hair. Mixed in with the breeze was a smell that couldn't easily be described as refreshing. It came from the place where they were heading, towards the dragon carriage.
            
            "───Please make sure to come back and apologize!!"</p>

            <p>With a loud voice, Rem threw her wish towards the receding dragon carriage. She couldn't tell them to come back safely. She couldn't even think about wishing them good luck. And yet, despite being pushed by Katya, she couldn't choose not to convey anything. What came out of Rem's troubled heart was that.</p>

            <p>Who is Natsuki Subaru to Rem? Desperate for her and yet, with Emilia and Beatrice around, risking his life for The Empire, being glared at by everyone for Spica's sake, what is he?</p>

            <p>"I won't forgive you until you tell me."</p>

            <p>It is not because of the foul reek that wafts around. It's because I - Rem with no "memories," who newly shaped my "memories" - want to know what sort of title to put on you, wherever you are.</p>

            <p>My loud voice might be swallowed by the wind, and I don't even know if it reached you properly.</p>

            <p>However, I saw a small hand waving back from the open window of the last of the three departing dragon carriage ──── a child's small hand.</p>
            
            <p>"How stupid. Smiling so happily."</p>
            
            <p>─── Rem thought she heard Katya sighing beside her on seeing her profile.</p>
