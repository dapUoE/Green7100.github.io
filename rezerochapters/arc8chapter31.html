            <p>"The Stone" Muspel. An ancient great spirit rooted in the land of the Vollachian Empire, named amongst the four great spirits. Unlike, "The Holy Beast", "The Slasher", "The Mediator" of other countries, it is a being that leaves no spontaneous actions or assertions in history. Even though it is known to be in Vollachia, no further information or sightings have surfaced, perhaps it might be the most spirit-like. That was the intrinsic existence of "The Stone" Muspel, who was simply regarded as a divine area."</p>

            <p>"But, while Beako explained it cutely, isn't the story different?"</p>

            <p>Subaru, who was lacking in knowledge of the four great spirits, had listened to the tale of Muspel interestingly as Beatrice spoke. However, the content greatly differed from the actual situation. The story goes that the great spirit whose whereabouts, even identity, were unknown was called Muspel...</p>

            <p>"The fact that you are sure it has been taken by the opponent, means that you had a hold of its location. So conversely, Muspel was in this fortress city. - Isn't that so?" With that said, Subaru pointed a stern question and finger at Abel's sullen face. Abel narrows his black eyes at Subaru's pursuit. However, before he could open his mouth...</p>

            <p>"Hey, how dare you speak like that to His Majesty, The Emperor" An unexpected rough tone barged into the space between Subaru and Abel, and a gust of wind blew. Immediately after, the white part of the fingernail Subaru was pointing gets shaved abruptly. Whoosh, the wind and the blade that cut the nail, made Subaru let out a scream of "What the hell!" by the unexpected event.</p>

            <p>And then-,</p>

            <p>"Brat! Understand your place, know your standing!"</p>

            <p>"That's my line! Don't suddenly cut a kid's fingertips with a sword!"</p>

            <p>With the sudden uncalled act, Subaru who held his hand, threw such words at the perpetrator - Jamal. Jamal, who was allowed to accompany Abel from Garkla for some reason, had pulled out a blade and had unexpectedly cut deep into Subaru's nail. At such a short-sighted act, Subaru turned his eyes filled with disbelief towards him.</p>

            <p>"I thought you became a bit better, but as expected, I don't like you!"</p>

            <p>"Huh? I don't care about being liked by a brat.... Anyway"</p>

            <p>He was naive to think that a rational conversation could be had, like the time when Todd's death was told to Katya.</p>

            <p>Jamal, demonstrating his persistent brute, seemed ready to have a glaring contest with Subaru despite their age difference. However, his immature attitude was halted by an raised hand.</p>

            <p>It was Abel, no matter who, sitting at the round table who commanded, "Stop it."</p>

            <p>"Do not cause unnecessary disputes. Your value to me is that you are a relatively easy piece to manipulate. Now is not the time to quarrel with the kingdom."</p>

            <p>"Quarrelling with the kingdom... ah"</p>

            <p>Subaru, furrowing his brows at Abel's choice of words, surmised his intent and looked behind. Then, he saw the eyes of blame from the kingdom's side--- of course, Emilia, Beatrice, Spica, and others--- directed towards Jamal. 
            
            If this glaring contest continues, their participation in the battle would soon be inevitable.</p>

            <p>However, Jamal, who seemed oblivious to the gravity of the situation, grimaced and reluctantly sheathed his spear of violence.</p>

            <p>"If His Majesty orders it... Tch, you're lucky, brat."</p>

            <p>"It's amazing that you can still say that in this situation. I feel like this alliance was just about to break and the empire was on the verge of ruin."</p>

            <p>Sighing at Jamal's attitude that remained unapologetic despite receiving the Emperor's halt, and gazes from Subaru's companions, Subaru looked at Abel. He may have described Jamal as easy to handle, but that seemed hardly the case.</p>

            <p>"You're not going to get assassinated or something in this stage, are you?"</p>

            <p>"In reality, if I turn against you, I probably won't be treated too harshly. This one's attitude as an imperial soldier is extremely normal... though slightly short-sighted, it’s not as bad as Cecilus."</p>

            <p>"Isn’t it cheating to compare him with Cecilus; it's just so unfair...!"</p>

            <p>Subaru was infuriated by Abel's unbearable joke and his presentation of an undeniable case. Ignoring Subaru, Abel waved Jamal away with his hand and turned his gaze back to Subaru.</p>

            <p>Now was the time to respond to Subaru's directed finger and his questions, to disclose information about the "Stone" that was diverted.</p>

            <p>"Addressing the question you asked earlier with bated breath, yes. The 'Stone' was in this city. It was used as a means to ground it, turning this city into a Divine Sanctuary."</p>

            <p>"Can that really be believed?" Again, Abel tapped the round table with his finger and revealed the truth with a stern sound. At Abel's response, the one who unexpectedly let out a voice was Beatrice. She frowned her cute little face, her lips pursed tight,</p>

            <p>"That's a preposterous story. The 'Stone', was the hardest to communicate with among the Great Spirits, or so I've heard from mother."</p>

            <p>"Among the Great Spirits, the hardest..."</p>

            <p>"Incidentally, the one who least listens among the Great Spirits is the 'Holy Beast', and the one most impossible to negotiate with is the 'Slasher'. The one most hopeless to talk to seems to be the 'Mediator'."</p>

            <p>"All equally terrible! Puck, please come back!"</p>

            <p>His shock was uncontainable when faced with an increasingly appalling lineup. Firstly, he understood that entities like the 'Slasher' and the 'Mediator' were difficult to communicate with. But what did it mean that even a Great Spirit referred to as the 'Holy Beast' fell into this untalkative category?</p>

            <p>"Mother said, the 'Holy Beast' is a well-intentioned ghost, I suppose."</p>

            <p>"Well, I do fancy seeing all of the landmarks in this world, but there isn't a single renowned person I wish to meet... Isn't that incredible?"</p>

            <p>Subaru, who had been living in this world for more than a year, occasionally heard the names of famous persons, but most of them had rather troubling titles, and he was tired of it.</p>

            <p>It might largely be because he had already met positive notable persons such as the royal candidates and the "Sword Saint". Anyway—</p>

            <p>"The term of grounding the 'Stone', and the term Divine Sanctuary are novel to me. Perhaps it is a unique saying of Vollachia, but what does it mean?"</p>

            <p>"Simply put, the 'Stone' is a great spirit that governs the earth attribute. Therefore, the land where it chooses to rest naturally gains its protective characteristic. In addition to creating a fertile soil, it also positively affects the livelihood of the beings residing in that land."</p>

            <p>"I see... it plays a much more significant role than I had imagined."</p>

            <p>Otto, who had inserted his question, expressed his admiration in response to Abel's answer by placing his hand to his mouth. In other words, farming thrives within the range of Muspel's influence, and the healing of the ill or injured also speeds up. Its effects seemed to be entirely beneficial, like a hot spring.</p>

            <p>If one could freely adjust Muspel's configuration, then—</p>

            <p>"Certainly, such information is far more crucial to keep hidden than the recovery of the castle town. The 'Stone' was one of the pillars supporting the empire's high national power, after all."</p>

            <p>"That such information was disclosed to us, foreigners. It gives a glimpse into— Emperor Vincent's level of resolve, is how I would interpret it."</p>

            <p>"Opening up too much can feel risky...but I agree with you on hating internal strife," Anastasia shared, reflecting the natural behavior of someone from a foreign power – like Julius and herself. Naturally, as Anastasia implied, they couldn’t rule out the possibility of disclosing information disadvantageous to the Empire.</p>

            <p>"But if it was something he really wanted to hide, wouldn't Abel have deceived us in many different ways? The fact that he didn't, I think, means that it's not," Emilia stated.</p>

            <p>"Emilia's right. The guy is cunning and full of tricks. If he wanted to, he could've deceived even the likes of Roswaal and Anastasia. It may not seem like it, but this is the most sincerity you'll get from Abel," Subaru added.</p>

            <p>"I am surprised to find the half-elf girl less offensive than you. In this world, such an evaluation is rare," Abel retorted, to which Subaru frowned for that ungrateful response despite their support.</p>

            <p>The one to bring a lull to this scene was Flop, who clapped his hands for attention. Nodding in agreement, he said, "The Emperor disclosed the truth. That alone shows the urgency of the matter and it was a topic that couldn't be avoided when explaining the worst-case scenario."</p>

            <p>"The worst-case scenario...does that have to do with the 'end of the Empire's land' mentioned by the Emperor?" Subaru asked.</p>

            <p>"Yes, indeed!" Flop affirmed, energetically nodding in response to Roswaal's confirmation.</p>

            <p>The 'end of the Empire's land’–this was the worst-case scenario of the "Great Disaster" that would fall on the Vollachian Empire, caused by the use of the "Stone", Muspel.</p>

            <p>And before this scenario was revealed to Subaru and the rest, the reason Abel had brought Flop—who was supposed to be just a civilian—was because...</p>

            <p>"The fake emperor tasked me with conveying information about the Sanctuary to The Emperor. But his true intention was not to cooperate with the 'Stone', the great spirit, but rather to warn about the possibility of the 'Stone' being used in their plan," Flop explained. 
            
            "I see. So, Flop, you met Abel's imposter directly?" Subaru asked.</p>

            <p>“Yeah. I don't have the right to answer or comment on why he acted the way he did...but I am the type to want to carry out what I was entrusted with,” Flop concluded.</p>

            <p>Flop, still pale from the lost blood, seemed unchanged in his sense of duty. The projected image of the imposter emperor had been a saving grace to Subaru, thinking about him in his heart. The imposter emperor's true intentions, after having battled with Abel and now having lost his life in place of him on the throne, were nevertheless hard to figure out and beyond their reach forever. However, it must have been one of the best strategies for the false emperor to have passed on his message to Flop.</p>

            <p>"Um, so does that mean the Empire and Muspel had a contractual relationship?"</p>

            <p>"If you refer to the contract your mind conceives as one between spirits and their manipulators, then no. The Stone does not possess such self-awareness. There's no point trying to propose an advantageous or equal contract."</p>

            <p>"It's quite typical of Vollachia to debate pros and cons in a spirit contract. Look at me and Beako, our relationship is pure, upright, and delightful."</p>

            <p>"Exactly."</p>

            <p>"You look like children playing around."</p>

            <p>A comment from Abel after Subaru and Beatrice held hands and took a quick step together. Ignoring Subaru's puffed cheeks in unison with Beatrice, Abel continued.</p>

            <p>"There are no contracts between me and the Stone. However, it stayed within the Empire's territory. That's why we used it... At the same time, it continued to travel through the depths of the empire, sinking its roots."</p>

            <p>"Roots?"</p>

            <p>"Think of it like the roots of a tree. The ground where the thick and long branches of a tree have spread is solid. But what happens to the ground if that tree is uprooted?"</p>

            <p>"…There'd be holes and instability. It would collapse with a single touch."</p>

            <p>Anastasia succinctly summed up Abel's question. Muspel, which continued to enrich the land of Vollachia, had tied its own fate and the empire itself in reciprocity.</p>

            <p>And—,</p>

            <p>"So if Muspel dies, it's all over for Vollachia, quite literally! That's insane!"</p>

            <p>In other words, it was like revealing the existence of a bomb that could blast the empire itself to pieces.</p>

            <p>An ongoing national secret that Vollachia would always have to deal with and keep hidden. The shock of that fact finally caught up with Subaru.</p>

            <p>But—,</p>

            <p>"Idiot, don't panic."</p>

            <p>"Are you expecting me to keep calm?! No way... Are you planning to silence all of us who know the secret once this is all settled?"</p>

            <p>"Don't belittle that. If I had such intentions, there's no way I'd allow even a hint of suspicion in you all. Intrigue and infighting isn't just the privilege of the Holy Kingdom."</p>

            <p>"Maybe it's best if both the empire that takes pride in that and the Holy Kingdom known for it were to perish?"</p>

            <p>Given the big circumstances, talk of whole nations enter the conversation. Needless to say about the empire, the Holy Kingdom also doesn't seem to be anything good. Subaru feels like he has endured quite severe trials, but yet he's made to realize that the Kingdom of Lugunica is far more comfortable to live in.</p>

            <p>"Well, it was undeniable that the Kingdom of Lugunica was the most heavenly place when I met Emilia and the others, even in the hell of this world."</p>

            <p>"Sorry, I don't understand what you're saying."</p>

            <p>"It's okay, it's just my ramblings. - So, the point of the previous conversation was about that"</p>

            <p>Subaru, with a smile, turned the flow of the conversation back to Abel, who had tilted his head in confusion. Catching the shift, Abel quietly crossed his arms and squinted,</p>

            <p>"There is no way a ruler would neglect such a blatant move, like entrusting the organs of the heart to others. Naturally, we were pushing forward with the disconnection with the "stone". Your concern, the difficulty of claiming their lives after finding those creatures, is nothing but nonsense. It's as good as challenging the dragon with a brush."</p>

            <p>"Ah! I see! That puts my mind at ease! But then, that doesn't connect to the story of not having enough time earlier. Sure, you might have been proceeding to disconnect, but isn't it true you didn't have time, hence this situation?"</p>

            <p>"......"</p>

            <p>"Don't keep quiet just because you're at a disadvantage!"</p>

            <p>Abel's reaction to Subaru's striking remark, his silence, was proof that Subaru's suspicion was correct. Eventually, Vollachia might be able to sever the fate tied with Muspel. However, it wasn't now, and it certainly wasn't a clue to get out of the urgent situation.</p>

            <p>"In other words, our imperial citizens and the "stone" are still bound by fate. If the horde of undead persists in chasing us, and if we desperately keep beating them back, eventually the "stone's" mana will be depleted and the destruction of our lands cannot be avoided. I heard that the soldiers who died in battle will revive immediately. Thus..."</p>

            <p>"It means both defeating the enemy excessively, and seeing our own men fall is undesirable, huh?"</p>

            <p>"That's the way it turns out. It's endlessly disgusting and an absurdly exciting arrangement."</p>

            <p>Overmatched, and forced into a defense battle with ruthless conditions set up. He did not understand why Serena was so gleeful, but he could see the relentless plot of the enemy, which was more than just a powerful push from an ordinary corpse, was a preparation to surely destroy the empire...</p>

            <p>"But, I wonder why Sphinx is doing such a thing?"</p>

            <p>"Huh?"</p>

            <p>At Emilia's sudden doubt, Subaru blinked in surprise. The identity and plan of the fearsome enemy - the "Witch" Sphinx who revives many of the dead buried in the empire's land for the purpose of the "Great Disaster" have become quite clear.</p>

            <p>However, the motive of the "Witch" that Emilia wondered, it was --</p>

            <p>"Well, she wants to destroy the empire ... I don't understand the feeling either."</p>

            <p>"Regardless of Natsuki-san's true feelings, that answer is insufficient for Emilia-sama's question. If the Margrave and Beatrice-chan confirm that the leader of the enemy is the same "Witch" who once rampaged the Kingdon of Lugunica, her resentment should be directed towards the kingdom."</p>

            <p>"Despite that, the "witch" has raised the dead in the empire. Certainly, it's not fitting. However, there is a possibility that the Empire was fit for her conditions."</p>

            <p>"Conditions, you say?"</p>

            <p>Otto and Julius crossed their gaze when Emilia raised her doubt. Julius put his finger on his thin chin to Otto, who was seeking the forefront of inference.</p>

            <p>"The army of zombies combined with the "Sacrement of the Imortal King" and restoration magic... To realize this, the presence of the four largest entities with exceptional mana was essential. Therefore, the "witch" carried out her formula in the empire."</p>

            <p>Julius paused there for a beat, looked at everyone's faces in the conference room, and continued.</p>

            <p>"It might also be her plan to destroy the empire first, and then invade the kingdom."</p>

            <p>"What...?"</p>

            <p>"-- Don't be absurd!!"</p>

            <p>At Julius' feared possibility, Subaru was speechless, and with a momentum to drown out his silence, Goz raised his roaring voice. Goz clenched his fist, which was about the size of a child's head, strongly, and grinded his teeth while maintaining the minimum level of reason not to destroy the round table.</p>

            <p>"If your thoughts are correct! Is our Vollachia being aimed for destruction just as a by-product!!"</p>

            <p>"Properly speaking, this is the first stage of a plan to hit the real target, yeah? Hmm, the whereabouts of 'The Stone' and the set up of the zombies have already been in motion for a bit longer, I guess," Anastasia supplemented.</p>

            <p>"Ugh...!!"</p>

            <p>Most likely, Anastasia had no intention of doing so, but her additional explanation did nothing to appease Goz's fury. Instead, it made Goz growl in vexation. Jamal was also furious, just like Goz. No one could accept their homeland's crisis being treated merely as part of another plan.</p>

            <p>As Subaru considered their feelings, he noticed Beatrice's expression next to him. "Beatrice?" he asked.</p>

            <p>"--- I can understand Julius's thoughts. But... Roswaal."</p>

            <p>"Ah, I understand your concern.  --- Whether that Sphinx harbors human-like feelings of revenge against the Kingdom. If so, it would appear that only half of Julius's theory is correct."</p>

            <p>"Half of Julius's idea?"</p>

            <p>"The conditions met in the Empire. So, we acted. That's all it is." At Roswaal's words, Subaru takes in a sharp breath. The stern-faced Beatrice next to him didn't say anything, which meant she agreed with him.</p>

            <p>If Julius's idea is correct, what happened in the Empire is not an isolated incident for the kingdom. However, if Beatrice and Roswaal are correct, it's an even more desolate situation.</p>

            <p>And then---</p>

            <p>"In any case, the 'Witch' has already drawn her bow towards the Empire. Having insulted the life of the Imperial family, there is no choice now but to destroy the enemy, right?"</p>

            <p>"Sounding quite hot-blooded there, Chancellor. Lamia, was it? Indeed, can't you stomach the circumstances?" Abel snorts.</p>

            <p>"---Hmm, and is there a problem with that?"</p>

            <p>Serena might have intended to be sarcastic, but if that was the case, her plans were dashed. Despite his unexpressive, squinted eyes, his face clearly reflected his anger towards his enemies, while maintaining a facade of calm on the surface.</p>

            <p>In response to Berstetz's words, Serena traced the scar on her face with her finger.</p>

            <p>"No problem? The Chancellor as you are now, is very much my type of man."</p>

            <p>"You have a terrifying taste," Berstetz blinked.</p>

            <p>"Hahaha! Even with scars, a woman can be attractive," Serena laughed heartily at the shifted emotional state of Berstetz.</p>

            <p>Ignoring their exchange, the reality was exactly as Berstetz had said. There was no choice but to decide the victor against Sphinx, the commander of the undead horde. Regardless of what her aim may be.</p>

            <p>"So, is Emilia okay?" *******************************************************************************************************
            ******************************************************************************************************</p>

            <p>"―Hmm. Even if I think hard, I don't understand what's happening right now. It would be good if there was a chance to hear directly from Sphinx……"</p>

            <p>"We only met for an instant, but she didn't seem like she wanted to talk much."</p>

            <p>"Betty also agrees with Subaru. It might be difficult to communicate with her."</p>

            <p>Sphix who targeted the chained carriage with her own life in a "death escape" tactic.</p>

            <p>The same goes for her disposable life tactics, she didn't feel any heat in her few conversations. An opponent who doesn't show emotion won't take the bait. It's the type of enemy Subaru is bad against.</p>

            <p>That said, even if he "Returned by Death", it would still be a tough enemy――.</p>

            <p>"While we're talking like this, the enemy is steadily increasing their number of zombies, and bit by bit whittling down the power of the great spirit Muspel. A drawn-out battle will only put us at a disadvantage."</p>

            <p>"And yet, gathering the forces from all over the empire for another attack on the imperial city is not feasible either. A clash between large armies would be a costly battle of attrition. The damage would only continue to grow."</p>

            <p>"A bound situation that can't cause damage to either us or them... In other words, the strategy to save the empire from the imminent "Great Disaster" is almost a single choice."</p>

            <p>Subaru, Anastasia, and Otto continued their discussion, and naturally, all eyes gathered on Abel who sat at the round table. All the people of the empire were the stakeholders, and the man at the top of these stakeholders accepted this gaze as natural and said,</p>

            <p>"Attack the imperial city with a small elite force, and apprehend the "Witch" who is the leader. Then disassemble the "Great Disaster" plan that they have carefully laid out."</p>

            <p>――He clearly declared the strategy to stop the "Great Disaster", the final phase of the battle that started in the Vollachian Empire.</p>

            <p>△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>The conclusion of the conference surrounding the round table was reached, and a pause was inserted.</p>

            <p>In accordance with the established policy, from here, the selection of personnel for the blitzkrieg and the strategy for attacking the imperial city will be formulated.</p>

            <p>However, before the discussion officially began――,</p>

            <p>"―I didn't expect that the "Stone" would be placed in Garkla."</p>

            <p>In the council room where only the Emperor and the Chancellor remained, it was Berstetz who started the conversation. This was a moment when not only the members of the kingdom that formed the alliance, but also imperial members like Serena and Goz had left their seats. Jamal, the guard, was also left outside the room, so this was indeed a discussion only between the leaders of the Empire-- there should have been one more person here.</p>

            <p>"So in essence, you were also tricked by Chisha's scheming,"</p>

            <p>"It seems so. If it went according to the plan, the sanctuary at this time was supposed to be near the southwestern cloud city of... Mezoreia. At what point did he steal it from my sight?"</p>

            <p>"You look as if your eyes are closed. It must have been easy to steal it."</p>

            <p>"Looks closed but isn't. That's why there are preventative measures... but to say it after being outwitted just sounds like a poor excuse."</p>

            <p>As he shook his head leisurely, Berstetz muttered as if regretting his wrong judgement. However, Vincent did not think it was Berstetz's fault.</p>

            <p>As it happened several times, Chisha exceeded the speculations of Vincent and Berstetz.</p>

            <p>Not only did he deceive the two people, the Emperor and the Chancellor, but Chisha also had a way to figure out what the approaching "Great Disaster" was trying to do.</p>

            <p>"If 'The Stone' was not in use, it would have been fine to secure defenses with the fortress city as the base. If 'The Stone' was taken, that means--"</p>

            <p>"That means it will be exploited for the purpose of the 'Great Disaster'. That fool... he seems to have thought of many ways to destroy the empire and carried it out in his head. Hence, he hit the mark."</p>

            <p>"We did not anticipate someone with the aim of destruction, rather than taking over. We will be more vigilant henceforth."</p>

            <p>"— Do so, please."</p>

            <p>At those words about the future prospects from Berstetz, Vincent felt a slight sting. He was considering the possibility that Berstetz might resign his position as Chancellor and die for Lamia after this matter is resolved.</p>

            <p>"Lady Lamia refused me."</p>

            <p>Spotting the doubt in that moment of silence, Berstetz answered. Hearing this, Vincent did not say anything and simply blew out a small breath from his nose. Reacting to Vincent's reaction, Berstetz continued,</p>

            <p>"I was rather surprised when you spoke about 'The Stone' and the sanctuary. I can't say we have a clear solution to separating 'The Stone' from our lands."</p>

            <p>"As soon as this matter is settled, we must proceed with the national policy that we put on hold. We have until the end of the non-aggression pact with the Kingdom, two years from now, to show results. Otherwise, there will be no tomorrow beyond today" said Vincent.</p>

            <p>"Indeed. Now then..."</p>

            <p>Berstetz placed a beat before opening his thin eyes a sliver.</p>

            <p>"I believe you understand, but let's not disclose how the "Stone" is controlled. Not just because it's confidential to the Empire, but also considering the sentiment of our allies."</p>

            <p>"Natsuki Subaru and the half-elf spirit arts user are likely fastidious. If they learn that we've contracted a death-row prisoner with the "Stone" and are using them until they die, we'll have trouble."</p>

            <p>"Your Excellency,"</p>

            <p>Berstetz rebuked Vincent for speaking so incautiously about it. During the meeting, when asked by Emilia if the "Stone" and the Empire were in a contract, Vincent had replied they were not in the contract she understood. That wasn't a lie, just a gloss over of the truth.</p>

            <p>The quickest way to keep the "Stone" in check is for a contract to be made between a human and a spirit. However, the "Stone" has no self-awareness, so no negotiation or communication is possible in the contract. Hence, the price of contracting with the "Stone" is universally a vast load of void that flows into the contractor. The feeling of sharing the body around the clock with an unfathomably large existence that is impossible to communicate with, will easily destroy a human's mind and drive it into a formless state. As a price for the inevitable ruin, the "Stone" has a tendency to stay where the contractor is.</p>

            <p>Therefore, in the Empire, they forced death-row prisoners to contract with the "Stone" and had them stay on necessary land in the divine territory, distributing the benefit of the divine territory elsewhere. Once you lose sight of where the "Stone" is, finding it is almost impossible, so replenishing death-row inmates is one of the most important matters.</p>

            <p>And before the decisive battle in the imperial capital began, Chisha, disguised as the emperor, moved the "Stone" to the city of Garkla and prepared for the "Major Disaster". However, there was no sign of the death-row inmate who had contracted with the "Stone" in the city.</p>

            <p>"If it's been moved, it would be impossible to find it again without any clues. Therefore, all that we gain from discussing the details would be distrust from our allies."</p>

            <p>"Even if we don't spell it out, we can surmise as such," Vincent remarked, recalling the participants of the meeting and narrowing his eye at several relevant persons. As Berstetz said, they would want to avoid internal discord under these circumstances. Likely, the ones who understood it without speaking were of the same opinion.</p>

            <p>In any case, from the moment it was stolen from the fortress city, "The Stone" was no longer a useful piece, but rather had turned into a destruction with an unknown whereabouts. If there's no better solution than capturing the body of the "Witch" called Sphix, then paying special attention to its existence is meaningless...</p>

            <p>"-"</p>

            <p>"Your Excellency?"</p>

            <p>Suddenly, Berstetz called out to the Emperor, inquisitive at the silently brooding Vincent.
            To that call, Vincent just shook his head sideways, saying, "No."</p>

            <p>For a moment, a certain thought had traversed his mind, but it was a far too slim possibility to incorporate into his future strategy. Especially when the entity in question is the one with the most unmanageable reins in the empire, followed by the next most difficult to handle thing...</p>

            <p>"If there's a possibility of locating "The Stone", it would be akin to a hound with a nose for unlikely prey, but that is wishful thinking."</p>

            <p>△▼△▼▼▲▼△▼▼▲▼△▼▼▲▼△</p>

            <p>At the same moment, somewhere in the Imperial Capital Lupgana...</p>

            <p>In the darkness, spread flat on the hard, damp ground, it lay motionless. The weight of its injuries was considerable, and the depletion of both physical and mental energy even larger. However, the most significant reason it couldn't move was due to an injury on something far higher than the heart, a crucial part of itself - the damage to its soul.</p>

            <p>It had been denied the very thing it had believed and prayed for all along, and was cast down to the ground. There was nothing it had cherished more since its birth till that day, yet it was rejected by that very thing itself.</p>

            <p>It had lost its meaning to live, its reason, and all it could do. It had abandoned its value, its significance of existence.</p>

            <p>In that state, simply lying flat on the damp ground, it raised and lowered its chest, breathing, and muttered,</p>

            <p>"Princess..."</p>

            <p>In a frail voice like it was clinging to, praying to the one who denied its existence, it muttered.
            It was weak, and could only continue to mutter.</p>
