            <p>"Huh? What did you just say?"</p>

            <p>"I will not say it thrice. ——If they are imperial citizens within the limits of my control since I ascended the throne, I can match all of their faces with their names."</p>

            <p>"Are you insane?!"</p>

            <p>Subaru's voice overturns in response to Abel's ridiculous answer. Abel crossed his arms, a solemn look on his face.</p>

            <p>They were inside a dragon coach and were in the middle of a journey from the fortress city Garkla to the imperial capital Lupgana, which had now turned into a base for the undead.</p>

            <p>Bulking up, the entry squads were divided up to board three dragon coaches that loaded both the kingdom's and the empire's personnel, as well as the necessary luggage— this being the "Vollachian Empire Rescuing Squad from Destruction". Currently, Subaru was intentionally riding in the dragon coach allocated to the Empire's personnel.</p>

            <p>This wasn't an act of betrayal against the Kingdom but simply due to something he desperately wanted to ask— the reason Abel, the Emperor, joined the entry squad. He wanted to know.</p>

            <p>Of course, given the crucial conflict deciding the survival of Vollachia, it was only natural for Abel to take the stage from a position standpoint. However, it was evident from their multiple shared experiences of unexpected crises that though Abel possesses wisdom, he lacks martial strength.</p>

            <p>In the path ahead in the imperial capital, he doesn't hold any persuasive power in terms of the pure combat strength required.</p>

            <p>Assuming Abel isn't thinking like an airhead Vollachian, there must be a reason to reverse that idea, if he's coming along. However, there could also be the pattern of him not wanting to speak in front of Kingdom's personnel, hence why Subaru went out of his way to board this coach.</p>

            <p>And then, when asked directly, "What good are you?"—</p>

            <p>"To match all citizens' faces with their names..."</p>

            <p>Subaru's mouth stays wide open, stunned by the ridiculously absurd statement. Seeing Subaru's reaction, Abel, the subject of the ridicule, frowned unpleasantly.</p>

            <p>"Don't get me wrong, it's not all imperial citizens. I could not grasp the identities of people with no public exposure, like the "Citizens of Shudrak" who continue to hide in the forest. Therefore, it's impossible to understand all imperial citizens."</p>

            <p>"What are you upset about? You're stupid enough already! You're saying that you remember all of your subordinates, the imperial soldiers, right?"</p>

            <p>"It's necessary."</p>

            <p>It was a sharp, single-word answer, but it was far from a common thought process.</p>

            <p>Of course, Abel wasn't just an ordinary man, and his remarkable ability to remember not only the names but also the faces of all the people in the Empire was highly significant in their current situation. Particularly because―</p>

            <p>"With that girl needing a name to remove the necromancer's collar," Abel casually mentioned.</p>

            <p>Upon Abel's quietly spoken words, Subaru turned his attention towards Spica, seated at the edge of the dragon wagon. As she was a person of importance, they couldn't just leave her behind. Just like Subaru, she had come aboard the same wagon. Spica was currently sandwiched between Medium and Beatrice, who refused to leave Subaru’s side and being gently quieted down.</p>

            <p>Abel's extraordinary memory served to bring out the full potential of Spica's Authority.</p>

            <p>Yet, there were still many uncertainties about how to manifest the power of "Star Eclipse" – its mechanism was too ambiguous. During the successful use of "Star Eclipe" by the royal princess Lamia Godwin, no one forgot her. This indicated that Spica did not "eat" the "name". Nonetheless, there was a sense that the proper pairing of a face and a "name" was the key to unlocking the Authority.</p>

            <p>Hence, the current predicament left them clinging to the method that had worked once before.</p>

            <p>"But, it's annoying that your infuriatingly unreal memory becomes useful for this…" Subaru muttered.</p>

            <p>"Sir Schwartz, isn’t that a bit unreasonable? However, how much his opponent has been cruelly cold to Lady Yorna, even if it's the ruthless Emperor," a voice chimed in.</p>

            <p>"Is this advice for him? Or a complaint against me, who wears his skin?"</p>

            <p>"It is, of course, a word of caution for Sir Schwartz."</p>

            <p>The one to nonchalantly respond and turn her face away from Abel’s gaze was Tanza, a girl adorned in a kimono. As a member of the assault team, she seemed to hold some convictions toward Abel, concerning the biggest reason for their battle, Yorna.</p>

            <p>According to rumors, Abel had resolutely turned down Yorna's advances, so it made sense that Tanza had little to no reason to think favorably of Abel— it could even be said that she thought less of him.</p>

            <p>"I'll have you know, Yorna Mishguire did not nurse her affections for me, but for a former emperor."</p>

            <p>"Eh, really? Your father or something?"</p>

            <p>"No, someone from a distant past. If you want to know in detail, it's best to ask her in person. At least, the chance to do so still exists, right, girl?"</p>

            <p>"Yes. Even now, I can sense Lady Yorna’s power," Tanza responded quietly, laying a hand upon one of her eyes, as directed by Abel.</p>

            <p>It wasn't a hopeful wish, but a firm confidence derived from the blessings of Yorna's power lent to Tanza. As long as that existed, Yorna's survival was guaranteed.</p>

            <p>However, the uncertainty of her situation in the imperial city was frustrating. Not just Yorna, Priscilla's whereabouts were unknown, Al stayed behind to assist her, and the whimsical instincts of Cecilus posed concern. His patience was running thin.</p>

            <p>"But considering all that...don't we have too much emphasis on firepower?"</p>

            <p>Subaru, holding back his impatience, posed this question as he re-evaluated the composition of the "Saving the Volachian Empire from Destruction. Abel narrowed his single eye in response, while Tanza tilted his head, puzzled.</p>

            <p>"An emphasis on firepower, you say?"</p>

            <p>"Yeah. We have me, Beatrice, Emilia-tan, Spica and Roswaal, and our anticipated ace, Garfiel, right?"</p>

            <p>"Did you just boast about Betty?"</p>

            <p>"Yeah, I did. I love you, lovely Beako."</p>

            <p>"Betty loves you, too."</p>

            <p>Interrupting midway, Beatrice and Subaru confirmed their love, with Subaru raising a single finger. Outside their royal carriage, Emilia and the others were boarding the one trailing behind.</p>

            <p>"Halibel-san over there too, Anastasia-san sent him as a secret weapon after all. This is supposed to be a battle for the Empire, but it's full of external cooperators."</p>

            <p>Of course, it's not like the strike team isn't composed of any imperial citizens.</p>

            <p>However, at the forefront is Abel, whose arrogance is monstrous, and Medium who joined the group after directly negotiating with him. Then there is Jamal, who for reasons unknown, was promoted to "General," and chosen to guard the emperor as a driver; a group of interesting characters.</p>

            <p>Medium and Jamal, though among the strongest in the empire, likely wouldn't be stronger than Garfiel.</p>

            <p>"Since Tanza's mine, isn't she essentially on our side?"</p>

            <p>"─────"</p>

            <p>"Wait? I thought I would get slapped for that...here comes the delayed reaction...!"</p>

            <p>"Please, don't say unnecessary things."</p>

            <p>Subaru yells, reeling from the slap that came with greater force than he was prepared for. Sinking to his knees with teary eyes, all he received from Tanza was a very cold look.</p>

            <p>He may have overstepped, but he was getting worked up for nothing.</p>

            <p>"Cough, cough! Looks like you're trying to make a statement, Your Excellency. Isn't it reasonable to tell us if we can't see the empire's sincerity?"</p>

            <p>"Yes, indeed, what can be done... Aghh!?"</p>

            <p>"Subaru!? What's happened!?"</p>

            <p>Caught off guard by the hoarse cry, Subaru let out a scream from his throat. As Beatrice hurriedly ran over, Subaru lunged at her, desperately seeking comfort. As Subaru and Beatrice embraced, a small, bent shadow stood in his line of sight - a figure that had appeared out of nowhere, Olbart Dunkelkenn, the "Vicious Old Man".</p>

            <p>"Subaru, calm down. It's just an old man who suddenly appeared out of nowhere."</p>

            <p>"When a small old man suddenly appears, it's either Olbart or a classic horror movie! Both are terrifying! This is bad! We're in danger!"</p>

            <p>"Ha, ha, always the comedian, aren't you, lad? You've always been a tiny one, but look at you now, all grown up."</p>

            <p>"Who do you think made me this way?! I'm doing fine! How about you?!"</p>

            <p>"I'm doing pretty well myself. Although I did lose my right hand along the way."</p>

            <p>Olbart casually waved his sleeve where his right hand used to be. Seeing this, Subaru was silenced, healed of any malicious thoughts towards the elder.</p>

            <p>Despite being an eccentric old man, it was a shrewd tactic to show his wound and seek sympathy.</p>

            <p>"But falling into his trap like this...!"</p>

            <p>"Leave your internal struggles for later. - We need to hear the details, Olbart Dunkelkenn."</p>

            <p>While Beatrice stroked Subaru's troubled head, Abel turned to Olbart. Addressing the older man, the emperor said,</p>

            <p>"This decision is about hunting down a necromancer in the imperial capital. I can imagine Goz crying outrageously at being left behind. Isn't it a pity?"</p>

            <p>"He has his own role to play. Of course, this also applies to you."</p>

            <p>"I'm over ninety now, you know? Don't you think overworking someone my age is rather pitiless?"</p>

            <p>"You can discuss your retirement after we resolve this crisis. But remember this."</p>

            <p>Unfazed by Abel, the emperor, Olbart kept his nonchalant attitude. Ignoring the disrespectful demeanor of the elder, Abel added a final remark.</p>

            <p>As a prelude, Olbart, lifting his eyebrows in confusion, was told, "I believe no occasion should arise that your bad habits would resurface until the end of your life."</p>

            <p>"..."</p>

            <p>"Therefore, it's an order. Don't let your lust spill out and fulfill your duty, Olbart Dunkelkenn."</p>

            <p>At Abel's short yet clear and resolute command, Olbart pursed his lips.</p>

            <p>This was a comment on a significant concern that Subaru harbored about Olbart, and it was also a wager to pre-emptively check him.</p>

            <p>If Olbart were to explode in rage here, there was no one in their dragon carriage capable of restraining him.</p>

            <p>However, after a moment of silence, Olbart slapped his own hip with his remaining left hand, saying, "Oh boy, I dislike young guys because they have room to grow. Even His Excellency is cold to an old man, it's a cruel world, isn't it?"</p>

            <p>"I am generous."</p>

            <p>"Ka-ka-ka-ka-ka!"</p>

            <p>Olbart chuckled as if he'd just heard the best joke of the century.</p>

            <p>Perceiving their exchange as the settling of a silent feud, an unnecessary tension finally unwound from Subaru's shoulders.</p>

            <p>Regardless of the humor in Abel's joke, they had managed to avoid a potentially explosive confrontation.</p>

            <p>"So... Olbart, will you be accompanying us all the way to the capital?"</p>

            <p>It seemed that Tanza was under the same tension as Subaru. At her question, slightly hardened with anxiety, Olbart narrowed his eyes under his expressive brows and said, "His Excellency has requested it. Plus, just staying idle while my own country is in danger would be ridiculous. And besides..."</p>

            <p>"Besides?"</p>

            <p>"There are others in the empire; at least the coward Moguro and that Cecilus lad are there."</p>

            <p>"...And Yorna."</p>

            <p>In the demonic capital, a temporary alliance formed - Subaru didn't know the details, but Tanza had acted in line with her own interests while Olbart, who had infantilized Subaru and his companions, was involved.</p>

            <p>While the two shared a complex relationship, their interactions put any animosity aside for the moment.</p>

            <p>Subaru was unfamiliar with the person named Moguro, but at the very least, he could rely on Yorna’s ability and character, and Cecilus was unquestionably competent, even proven by his exemplary character. Adding Olbart to these, indeed, the military force of the empire could be said to be well-fortified.</p>

            <p>"But we have Halibel-san, so even with you guys, we're somewhat superior... I mean, you're also my ally," Subaru said.</p>

            <p>"Your understanding of the situation would suffice if you were put on a leash. Such an understanding reveals your degree of comprehension," a voice responded.</p>

            <p>"Ah, that Halibel guy has come. He's the only shinobi in this world who is stronger than I am, so I really hate him," a disgruntled retort followed.</p>

            <p>With the cards they held, these two strongest individuals freely expressed their opinions. As for Abel's reasons and stance for joining and the strength of the imperial side, the route ahead had been established with Olbart's union. Most of Subaru's doubts were largely resolved. There were some additional areas he still wanted to explore - such as how Medium had become a candidate for Empress - but they'd been mostly put to rest.</p>

            <p>"We'll save the talk about Medium-san for later. Rem also told me," Subaru decided as he held onto the delicate hand of Beatrice, feeling her soft grip.</p>

            <p>Subaru, as they were about to depart, remembered the send-off words that Rem had given him from inside the fortress. The content was so positive that he saw it as a call for his return and a prayer for his safety.</p>

            <p>"I might be scolded a lot when I return, but until it actually happens, I'll choose to believe that Rem has been worried," Subaru declared.</p>

            <p>"You... You don't have to think so negatively... She was just concerned about you," came a reply.</p>

            <p>"I also interpreted it that way..." another voice added.</p>

            <p>"C'mon, both of you don't understand Rem at all. Sure, Rem is kind, so there might be some of that, but most of it is anger towards me... No, no, stay positive, stay positive...!" Subaru caught himself before he inadvertently broke his own positive spell and quickly restored it again.</p>

            <p>Beatrice and Tanza looked at Subaru with pity, but the magically reassured Subaru was indifferent to their gaze. Their disapproval was merely water off a duck's back.</p>

            <p>"Your Excellency, we are almost at the relay point, the dragon carriage will stop once," came a report, as a man peeked in from the carriage's small window.</p>

            <p>Just as Subaru was mentally rearming himself, a report from Jamal, who had been scouting around the moving carriage, jumped in. Spotting Olbart, who was not supposed to be by Abel's side, gave Jamal a fright. His reaction amused Olbart, who waved back cheerfully, making the situation all the more irksome.</p>

            <p>Regardless, once he reached the reported relay point, Subaru planned to return to the dragon car on the kingdom side, where Emilia and the others were. But before that, spotting Jamal from the small window, Subaru casually coined, "Hey."</p>

            <p>"I kind of overheard this, but you said you were going to die for Katya, didn't you?"</p>

            <p>"Huh? What about it, brat?"</p>

            <p>"No, isn't that strange? Katya is incredibly saddened by the loss of her fiancé. Can't you imagine what she would feel if she lost her family?"</p>

            <p>Upon hearing Jamal's bold declaration to Katya about his noble death, Subaru doubted Jamal's sanity and felt dizzy, wondering if the situation in Vollachia was really that grave.</p>

            <p>Hence, Subaru wanted him to retract his dubious remarks and intended to have Jamal pledge to return alive to Katya. However, Jamal unamused by Subaru's words, snorted,</p>

            <p>"Listen here, brat, don’t speak of trivial matters."</p>

            <p>"Trivial? What's trivial?"</p>

            <p>"Do you think it matters if Katya cries when I die? The importance lies in how my death can serve the nation and the superior, and whether I'll be rewarded posthumously."</p>

            <p>"The way you guys lightly disregard lives for the sake of honor…"</p>

            <p>"You don't get it, you brat! She's a woman who can't stand on her own, nor bear a child! Without Todd, she wouldn't have a man in her life! Katya needs money to survive!"</p>

            <p>Jamal hollered at Subaru, who tried to argue back, spitting out his rebuttal. Jamal then looked past Subaru at Abel in the background and said,</p>

            <p>"I am the third in command now. If I prove useful here, I might even be treated as the second when I die. That would guarantee Katya's safety. As Katya's brother, I can do more for her when I'm dead than alive!"</p>

            <p>"At…"</p>

            <p>Subaru was left speechless by Jamal's intense way of thinking.</p>

            <p>"Suba-chan…"</p>

            <p>Looking at the silent Subaru, Medium lowered her brows in concern. But she didn't challenge Jamal's logic either. Similarly, Abel and Olbart remained silent.</p>

            <p>Jamal's opinion was sound. From the viewpoint of the Imperial people, it was a common sentiment.</p>

            <p>Only Beatrice, tentatively taking a half-step closer, aligned her shoulder with Subaru's in a gesture of solidarity.</p>

            <p>"Ah,"</p>

            <p>—No, Spica too, gently placed her hand on Subaru's back, offering unwavering support.</p>

            <p>"......"</p>

            <p>In regard to Jamal's logic, Subaru's viewpoint stemmed from an emotionally-driven standpoint, naivety in the face of the Empire's reality. However, Jamal's assertions, and the absolute silence from Abel and the others were wrong. If they were to die and be rewarded for their services, ensuring the continuity of Katya's livelihood, then Jamal should aim to live, thrive and climb the ranks. That way, he could protect Katya with his hard-earned salary.</p>

            <p>"If Abel's payroll for a 'General' isn't laughably low, it’s possible, right? You got that, Jamal?"</p>

            <p>"Huh? What are you...?"</p>

            <p>"I’m going to stop this future you've outlined at all costs. You can't – absolutely cannot die, you hear?"</p>

            <p>Subaru declared so with a fierce determination, gritting his teeth together.</p>

            <p>Hearing his words, everyone in the surroundings reacted. Abel faintly snorted through his nostrils; Olbart grinned, showing his teeth in an amused but silent laugh. Tanza tightly embraced her own arm while Medium, after rounding her eyes in surprise, nodded her approval.</p>

            <p>And there, Beatrice and Spica stood beside Subaru, glaring at Jamal.</p>

            <p>Upon locking eyes with the trio, Jamal squinted his eye not covered by an eye patch.</p>

            <p>"You're a bunch of creepy kids," he muttered.</p>

            <p>"We've been told the same by your friends. But, won't stop anyway," Subaru retorted.</p>

            <p>Before the small window could shut completely, they exchanged these last words. Jamal then returned to his duty as guard, watching the perimeter as they halted at their relay point. Subaru, having seen this, closed his eyes, and confronted his own heart.</p>

            <p>He understood Jamal had his own thought process. And that this was one of the societal norms within the Empire. Still, keeping this in mind, the whole thing made him want to scream out in disgust.</p>

            <p>"To die and save another person— that's..."</p>

            <p>Even for Abel, it was nothing but a painful, almost unbearable strategy. Therefore, Natsuki Subaru, more than anyone else, had to continuously reject this way of living - or rather, dying.</p>

            <p>Contrary to the speedy pace of their carriage, the imperial capital seemed frustratingly far. Thinking about all that was happening there, his anxious heart screamed to go faster.</p>

            <p>His feelings echoed with the urgency to hurry, to get there as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p>△▼△▼△▼△</p>

            <p>---The scene shifted, swapping to an unsettled circumstance beneath the same sky.
            
            Dark, pregnant clouds hung low, a forecast of doom for the crumbling empire. The capital city of Lupgana had turned into a city of the dead, flooded by an enormous volume of water flowing from the broken stopwater wall, and many of its living inhabitants had become corpses inside its star-shaped embankment.</p>

            <p>Among the wandering revived dead and the survivors who kept fighting in fear of being discovered - there were also some formidable people who were not only hidden and lurking but trying to fight for their lives.</p>

            <p>However, most of those who took up arms would come to regret their hasty decision. Once the fighting began, it meant an endless struggle with the continuously resurrecting dead, comparing one's vitality with those who had already exhausted their life force, a contest they could never hope to win. Ironically, the brave ones succumbed first, joined the ranks of the dead, and went off in search of the next living person.</p>

            <p>By now, the capital had become a city in the spiral of death, where the dead called out to the dead, a manifestation of hell where despair was brought to a boil. Still...</p>

            <p>"---Although the situation is indeed unusual, I find it quite uninteresting. At the very least, a few more dramatic moments would make my triumphant return to the stage more exciting!"</p>

            <p>The boy ruffled his gathered blue hair in the damp wind that carried a sour scent as he made such a comment while scanning his surroundings, shading his eyes with his hand.</p>

            <p>His blood-filled flesh and blue eyes showed none of the recognizable features of the living dead. Still, his ability to calmly survey the dystopian scenery in the transformed capital city was in some ways even farther removed from the standpoint of the living than the perspective of the corpses.</p>

            <p>To some, he might be viewed as a transcendent entity permitted to act freely, someone who made even the basic distinction between living and dead seem meaningless.</p>

            <p>Regardless, there resided in the boy's eye a brightly cheerful kind of insanity—not because he held no fear for this situation, but because he had never once felt fear since his birth, hence the deemed madness.</p>

            <p>"Well now, I suppose it would be quite legendary for me to cut down all the enemies in sight one by one and single-handedly repaint this battlefield... But..."</p>

            <p>With a playful look in his eyes, the boy continued to survey the hellish scene before him. His words hung with a hint of regret and anticipation for whatever was about to unfold next.</p>

            <p>The boy, whose gaze could instill fear in others, lowered his hand and ceased his far-off gazing, tilting his head.</p>

            <p>"Why, I wonder? I just can't see this leading to a good outcome!"</p>

            <p>With a helpless shrug, the boy conceded to his own intuition.</p>

            <p>With his capabilities, it was no exaggeration to say that he alone could cut down the majority of the undead plaguing the Imperial Capital. Yet, he chose not to, burdened by his inability to articulate a reason for his hesitance.</p>

            <p>From the perspective of the people suffering in the Imperial Capital, his concerns might appear ludicrous, even bordering on the privileged. Yet for the boy, they were a profound source of torment. They held no meaning or understanding for anyone but him.</p>

            <p>Emoting an understanding hum, the boy sighed in exasperation.</p>

            <p>"I can't quite explain it. What do you think about it?"</p>

            <p>"Don't... know, but..."</p>

            <p>"Right."</p>

            <p>"Is there any reason why we can't have this conversation after...?"</p>

            <p>The boy crouched down, peering into the depths below.</p>

            <p>In his field of vision, a man with a metal helmet held onto the edge of a tall building, where they had picked as a temporary respite, desperately trying to keep himself from falling. The man was supporting his whole body with one hand out of necessity, as the man was one-armed, leaving him with no choice but to do so.</p>

            <p>The boy — Cecilus — was looking down at the man in such a precarious situation, chuckling.</p>

            <p>"I'm afraid it won't work, Al. Until I understand exactly what you are, I cannot decide whether I should let you accompany me in my future endeavors!"</p>

            <p>Below the beaming Cecilus, the man, Al, swallowed nervously.</p>

            <p>The Imperial Capital Lupgana had become a hell brimming with a deadly spiral of the undead summoning the undead, yet...</p>

            <p>"Damn it, it really sucks..."</p>

            <p>At least at this moment, all that was unfolding was the living questioning the worth of life, a moment devoid of any conflict.</p>
