        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>On top of a hill, a lone man stood, gazing at the distant horizon. Time had passed since the sun had set, and the dimly lit, cold village couldn't conquer the night. All the more, with many of the men wounded and fewer bonfires than usual, the sight of this man standing in the darkness struck the young girl as quite peculiar.</p>
            
            <p>Robbers, who had been ravaging neighboring villages, had turned their sights on her home, stealing livestock and foodstuffs and causing great damage. Even so, the fortune was that the village wasn't annihilated, and that the figure standing on the hill contributed somewhat to this fortunate situation.</p>
            
            <p>When the bandits attacked, the resisting men were killed or wounded, and the women and children were captured one after the other. Given the likelihood that she would be sold or subjected to even worse. Then, the soldiers dispatched from the city, including the man on the hill, appeared.</p>
            
            <p>They swiftly surrounded the bandits and virtually wiped them out without resistance. After that, citing the need for protection and reconstruction assistance, they set up camp near the village and responded efficiently. The village now had a more robust boundary than before the bandit's attack.</p>
            
            <p>Once the men's wounds healed, the village would be safe for now. The girl, like the adult women, was busy running around taking care of the wounded, cooking for the soldiers, and attending to the village children. She spotted the man on the hill on her way home after things had settled down.</p>
            
            <p>"-------"</p>
            
            <p>One could describe the sight of the man silently gazing into the night's darkness as absurd. Staring into the darkness where you could see nothing is the epitome of a futile act. Actions not leading to results are worthless; such is the harsh custom of the empire.</p>
            
            <p>However, the girl didn't find the man's actions absurd. She perceived him as intensely trying to verify something that others couldn't see. She became intrigued about what he was trying to see.</p>
            
            <p>"Wouldn't counting the stars in the sky relax your mind more than staring into total darkness?"</p>
            
            <p>Before she knew it, she had called out to the man's back. As he turned around, a flicker of surprise flashed in his eyes, and for some reason, she felt proud.</p>
            
            <p>--- That was the encounter of the girl and the king, a tale to be told for a long, long time henceforward.</p>
            
            <p>---That reunion was unexpected.</p>
            
            <p>Was it a jest of fate, or something to be called serendipity?</p>
            
            <p>In the Vollachian Empire, battered by an unprecedented crisis, almost everyone became aware simultaneously of the entirety of the "Great Disaster".</p>
            
            <p>The march of the resurrected dead as undead unleashed chaos across the living.</p>
            
            <p>However, there were those who tasted this unavoidable plunge into chaos, who managed to rise again. They stood as spiritual warriors, irrespective of their physical prowess. Seen through the eyes of an ordinary person, they were heroes, outstanding individuals. More often than not, these formidable individuals were physically strong as well, their actions significantly affected the fate of the imperial city.</p>
            
            <p>The first strike of the "Great Disaster" turned out to be the worst sneak attack on the living but the carnage fell far short of simple conjectures.</p>
            
            <p>But even though it indicated a valiant fight on the side of the living, it did not mean the best outcome was achieved.</p>
            
            <p>That's because even those who deserved to be counted as heroes were swallowed up by the first assault quicker than they could rise from the initial chaos.</p>
            
            <p>"---Nn"</p>
            
            <p>A faint sigh escaped her lips as his consciousness gradually drifted towards awakening. Her eyelids, framed by long eyelashes, trembled as her pupils slowly projected the world onto her retinas like the sun afraid of dawn. Once, then twice, those blue eyes blinked, and the momentary bubble of a dream popped, firmly anchoring her consciousness in reality.</p>
            
            <p>"---"</p>
            
            <p>When she hurriedly sat up, her line of sight was filled with an unknown place.</p>
            
            <p>The room with a high ceiling, its walls and floors, and the craftsmanship on it, everything was top-notch. In this high-quality room, the furnishings suited the upscale decor, immediately painting the picture of a place with a noble ambiance.</p>
            
            <p>In this spacious room, the realization that she was sprawled on a soft bed augmented the understanding that this itself was strange. It was incongruently unnatural when compared to her most recent memory.</p>
            
            <p>"I was in the battle of the imperial city…"</p>
            
            <p>She looked back upon herself, being involved in it.</p>
            
            <p>Instantly, what comes back to her is a world dyed completely in red, where she tirelessly calmed a crying child alongside a girl with whom she had a miraculous reunion.</p>
            
            <p>It was literally a taxing situation, but the endeavor itself should have been successful.</p>
            
            <p>But here she was, in such a place. It was just too mysterious—</p>
            
            <p>"---A kimono?"</p>
            
            <p>She pauses in thought, belatedly noticing how unfamiliar the sensation of her hand against her own chest feels. Looking down at her own body laying in the bed, she realizes she isn't clad in the familiar kimono she is used to, but instead in a high-quality blue dress, wrought from luxurious fabric. Her hair, usually tied up, is now undone with not a trace of the hair and ear ornaments she usually wears. To her, these belongings represent things irreplaceable and should never have been taken from her while she was unconscious –-,</p>
            
            <p>"---Are you awake, my star?" The words enter her ears just as she is about to rise from the bed to search for her lost ornaments.</p>
            
            <p>"---Ah!" She reacts, all cognitive functions abruptly ceased by the unexpected vibration against her eardrums stirred by the voice. The voice has come from the room's entrance, an elegant spectacle of resplendent furnishings demanding attention. Yet, she takes no notice of any of it. As if her hearing is drowned out, as if her heart is captured, her consciousness is drawn towards that direction. It was something that she – Yorna Mishigure – could not avoid.</p>
            
            <p>"------" Yorna, wide-eyed on the bed, fixes her gaze at the silhouette standing in the doorway. A small figure stands there - shorter than she, with a thin, child-like frame, yet with the face of a stern, well-feathered man. His hair, a shade of green close to black that reaches his shoulders, and his unhealthy looking deep-set eyes evoking irritability, all seemingly reflect his unwelcoming character. But she knows that while people fear him, he does not intentionally push others away. At least, he had never pushed her away. Even at the final moment of...</p>
            
            <p>Indeed, this is why she, Yorna, is here now. She knows this well...</p>
            
            <p>"...Is it you, Sir?"</p>
            
            <p>"You speak strangely, but I'll allow it. Because all is related to your soul..."</p>
            
            <p>Startled and filled with disbelief, Yorna questions and the short man responds. His responses, dry, curt and impersonal, yet heavily laden with melancholy, despite their brevity, are saturated with an intensity of emotions. These sentiments stem from an intense obsession amounting to more than any human can bear and the root of this obsession lies in love.</p>
            
            <p>The man before her was in love with Yorna Mishigure. It wasn't that she understood this because she was gifted with the ability to be especially receptive to "love," but that it was an overwhelmingly clear and intense emotion that anyone on the scene would be able to discern.</p>
            
            <p>But then again, it was never likely for anyone else to be at the scene.</p>
            
            <p>For this was——,</p>
            
            <p>"A rendezvous after a gap of nearly three hundred years. I won't permit anyone to interrupt us."</p>
            
            <p>"——"</p>
            
            <p>"Let me get a good look at your face. No matter how much your appearance has changed, I wish to see your blinking up close."</p>
            
            <p>Yorna's heart quivered at the man's proclamation as he slowly approached. The emotion causing this trembling she couldn't quite put a finger on. Of course, there was the impulse to rejoice in the impossible reunion and leap into his arms.</p>
            
            <p>However, at the same time, she had three hundred years' worth of reasons as to why she should not. The most significant reason that prevented her from acting impulsively was, in particular, the events of the last several decades.</p>
            
            <p>Therefore, as the man approached, Yorna, still harboring conflicting emotions, trembled her lips and muttered—,</p>
            
            <p>"You are Yougard Vollachia,"</p>
            
            <p>As Yorna called his name, he ceased his steps. Her lower lip tightened. If he stopped when called that way, she knew she couldn’t be mistaken. There was no way she could be mistaken. Even if others had been wrong, Yorna— or the soul that originated from a girl named Iris— could never mistake him for someone else.</p>
            
            <p>That’s to say, Yorna, or rather the soul that originated from a girl named Iris, could never mistake the man known as the "King of Thorns," Yougard.</p>
            
            <p>——Iris and the King of Thorns.</p>
            
            <p>It was both an old fairy tale told in this world and a bygone piece of history. A story known for depicting the encounter and separation between a girl named Iris and the Vollachian Emperor known as the "King of Thorns," and their tragic ending.</p>
            
            <p>Yorna Mishigure symbolized the soul of Iris that did not ascend to heaven but was tied to the great land of the empire and underwent many reincarnations. And the one who tied Iris’s soul to the land of the empire was none other than the "King of Thorns," Yougard Vollachia.</p>
            
            <p>Therefore, this is the untold epilogue to the story “Iris and the King of Thorns.”</p>
            
            <p>“But it's nowhere near a beautiful story,” Yorna shook her head dismissively and suppressed the urge inside her chest.</p>
            
            <p>Meeting Yougard again after an unwelcome separation, it could be said that this was Yorna's fervent wish. In a way, it could be said that this was the moment when her wish was fulfilled.
                
            But it wasn't. This wasn't the kind of reunion Yorna had envisioned.</p>
            
            <p>"I never wanted to see your face or eyes like this, m'lord," she sighed.</p>
            
            <p>Mocked by the cruel nature of fate, Yorna looked at Yougard with a sorrowful anger.</p>
            
            <p>He who stopped in his tracks, accepting Yorna's gaze — the beloved emperor, his pale skin housing golden eyes. He had changed too much from the figure she knew.</p>
            
            <p>Specifically, she had no idea what had happened to him.</p>
            
            <p>She only knew for certain that Yougard's appearance was not normal and would in no way be beneficial to her or her beloved children.</p>
            
            <p>The transformed Yougard, who had impossibly resurrected — If she had awakened in an unfamiliar place and it happened to be a room in the Crystal Palace, the worst possibilities ran through her head. Like a radical event had occurred and altered the status of the empire.</p>
            
            <p>"M'lord, what on earth happened that you're like this..."</p>
            
            <p>The conversation she wanted to have was abundant, like tears that never dried.</p>
            
            <p>However, Yorna tried to shake it off and bring up what she needed to ask.</p>
            
            <p>But...</p>
            
            <p>"—Our star."</p>
            
            <p>Her enquiry was halted by Yougard raising a single finger.</p>
            
            <p>Not that the gesture had any physical power to stop Yorna's voice. Accompanied by that gesture, a sharp pain gripped Yorna's heart, silencing her.</p>
            
            <p>"Ah, ugh..."</p>
            
            <p>A severe pain pierced her heart, and a moan slipped from Yorna's throat in place of her question.</p>
            
            <p>Yorna's reflexively held chest, if you looked there, you'd see a design that was not there on the dress earlier — a grey thorn had been added.</p>
            
            <p>The thorn was spinning in the center of Yorna's chest, reaching through her white skin to the inside.</p>
            
            <p>The thorn of the thistle pierced Yorna's heart, commanding a tremendous pain over her whole body. Moreover, it slipped through Yorna's fingers when she tried to touch it, remaining untouched.</p>
            
            <p>Among the thoughts whitened by the pain, what passed through Yorna's mind was Yougard's nickname — the successive emperors of Vollachia were called various names due to their governance and achievements, but the one that represented Yougard was the "King of Thorns".</p>
            
            <p>Literally, Yougard binds and controls others with a thorn's pain. The untouchable thorns he implanted made sure of that - he was a great emperor who expanded the empire's territory to its current form by controlling its people with pain and fear.</p>
            
            <p>Writhing in unbearable pain, Yorna's throat trembled as she gasped for breath. It reminded her of her unguarded moments during the battle around the imperial city - after Priscilla and her had taken down the crying and raging Arakia.</p>
            
            <p>It wasn't something big. As Yorna was entranced by Yougard's appearance at the scene, she couldn't evade the binding of the thorns. Carrying the bound Yorna and unconscious Arakia, Priscilla was left to confront Yougard and the many golden-eyed beings following her.</p>
            
            <p>"Is Prisca safe?"</p>
            
            <p>Her question came out amidst intense, sharp pain. The fact that her lips leaking moans of enduring pain could articulate a meaningful question was solely because her emotional concern surpassed her physical pain.</p>
            
            <p>The delivered pain did not falter one bit. Yougard did not loosen his thorny binds. Whether it's Yorna or Iris, it's the same. From the start, Yougard's actions were not to vent his anger or to administer punishment. Planting thorns, binding others - for Yougard, it was as natural as breathing.</p>
            
            <p>Just like humans walk on two legs, Yougard binds others with thorns. The cries of those deeply pierced by these thorns, the flowing blood, were nothing more than means for him to interact with others.</p>
            
            <p>Therefore, being with him meant to exist in this pain. Having remembered that firsthand, Yorna managed to form a slight smile at the corners of her mouth and uttered her question.</p>
            
            <p>"Those two who were with me at the scene, are they safe?"</p>
            
            <p>"If you say they were with you, they did not come across my eyes. The only thing that enters my eyes are my stars, and you."</p>
            
            <p>"So is that so..."</p>
            
            <p>Yougard’s answer to her consecutive question was not what Yorna hoped for. Seeing Yorna's tone falter because of that, Yougard narrows his eyes slightly, as if pondering about something,</p>
            
            <p>"... However, the witch let living beings into the castle. Those whom you're referring to might be there,"</p>
            
            <p>On hearing this addendum from Yougard, Yorna held her breath faintly.</p>
            
            <p>Yougard's eyes, unlike the azure ones remembered, now bore golden light in a black iris. Yet, his tender gaze as he looked towards Yorna, alongside his clumsy concern, reminded her of the unchanging man he was. And feeling a pain that differed from thorns constricting her chest, she spoke,</p>
            
            <p>"If that's the case, sir, I have a request."</p>
            
            <p>"A request?"</p>
            
            <p>"Erm... Was she the 'witch'? I wish to confirm if the 'witch' who was allowed inside the castle was actually the one accompanying me."</p>
            
            <p>She wanted to ensure the safety of Prisca and Arakiya. For Yorna, who still could not fully comprehend the situation, confirming the two's wellbeing was her immediate priority. If that could happen —</p>
            
            <p>"Will you give up on death, my star?"</p>
            
            <p>The words Yougard uttered pierced Yorna's heart with a different pain.</p>
            
            <p>"......"</p>
            
            <p>Without uttering a sound, Yorna lifted her face. Yougard looked down at her. At his words, she couldn't immediately come up with anything to say. She couldn't utter anything foolish, such as a retort. His words struck at her true intentions, unerringly so.</p>
            
            <p>To be bound by the earth of the empire in soul, to revive with a new name in a new body every time she dies — it was the wish Iris bore and the cycle Yorna had been swept up in. This truth, Yougard Vollachia had seen through precisely.</p>
            
            <p>"…Blood is, an indisputable thing."</p>
            
            <p>And the same truth had also been seen through by Vincent Vollachia. Therefore, Yorna chose to ally herself with Vincent, throwing herself into the fight to regain the imperial capital from the rebels. While the collapse of the demon city played a significant role, she thought it dishonest to waver about her true feelings. Therefore, she nodded in response to Yougard's question.</p>
            
            <p>"If it means saving their lives, my death is a small matter."</p>
            
            <p>"Very well. I'll grant your wish, my star."</p>
            
            <p>Against Yorna's smile, braving the pain, Yougard impassively nodded.</p>
            
            <p>Then, he renewed his halted steps, getting in front of Yorna, and gently reached out to touch her cheek. As opposed to his tender touch, his finger was cold, and the thorns of the packed distance dug in deeply.</p>
            
            <p>"Wait for a while."</p>
            
            <p>Releasing his hand from Yorna, who experienced a piercing pain in both body and mind, Yougard left those words behind as he turned his back.</p>
            
            <p>As always, he had a knack for swift action once he had made a decision. Embracing such feelings, Yorna voiced a question towards Yougard's back, who was moving towards the room's door.</p>
            
            <p>"What happened to the kimono I originally wore, and my hair and ear accessories?"</p>
            
            <p>"They are not to my liking. But they adorn you. I have kept them."</p>
            
            <p>Saying so, Yougard indicated a shelf next to the bed with his hand and concluded his response to Yorna without wasting any further words.</p>
            
            <p>His lack of elaboration as he left the room was genuinely characteristic of the Yougard that Yorna knew. In his lifetime, he always seemed to be living in a rush, as if constantly being chased by time.</p>
            
            <p>Wanting to tell such a him that there's no need to be in hurry, Iris lined up next to him and said--</p>
            
            <p>"...like a fragile little girl."</p>
            
            <p>Gently shaking her head, Yorna extricated herself from the bed and reached for the shelf.</p>
            
            <p>Opening the drawer, she found her kimono and obi neatly folded inside, with a bag containing her hair and ear decorations alongside them. A sigh of relief spilled from her lips.</p>
            
            <p>Perhaps because the sense of relief was too great--</p>
            
            <p>"--ah"</p>
            
            <p>A thin, uncharacteristic sound leaked from Yorna's throat at the same time a heat travelled across her cheeks.</p>
            
            <p>"Crap."</p>
            
            <p>Bending forward, Yorna tightly bit her teeth to hold back a sob.</p>
            
            <p>She shouldn't be crying. Those tears threaten to dissolve the firmly constructed "colorfulness," that is Yorna Mishigure, the mistress of the magical city, back into a mere village girl named Iris.</p>
            
            <p>To become Iris again means narrowing her affection down to just one individual.</p>
            
            <p>It means undoing her 300 years of existence; of being someone's child, someone's parent, and someone's wife. Of negating all the days she spent interacting with others.</p>
            
            <p>"Why now, sir... Why at this moment?"</p>
            
            <p>She wanted to stay true to herself, to be able to love Prisca and the inhabitants of the magical city, and all the other beings living in this empire.</p>
            
            <p>The pain in her chest, like demanding thorns, was trying to make her forget that.</p>
            
            <p>That insanely nostalgic sweet pain was too terrifying for Yorna.</p>
            
            <p>It was too much to bear.</p>
